Bukit Batok CC is located within walking distance from Bukit Batok MRT station and Bukit Batok bus interchange.

The CC is well-known for its various music groups. Its symphonic band, West Winds, holds its own annual concert while its Chinese Orchestra has performed at numerous local events. If you want to try your hands at traditional musical instruments, you are welcome to join the CC’s Gamelan troupe!

If music is not your cup of tea, you can enroll in one of the CC’s popular courses such as ballet dancing, social dancing or yoga.

The CC’s Malay Activity Executive Committee (MAEC) runs a ‘Progress Class’ tuition and mentoring scheme where tertiary students guide needy students from primary schools.

After your visit to the CC, take a walk at the lush Bukit Batok Neighbourhood Park, or at the bustling Bukit Batok Central or West Mall nearby.
