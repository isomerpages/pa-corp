### Paya Lebar Kovan Community Club

Paya Lebar Kovan CC is the only CC to have an Adventure Park, which features Height Traverse (a station equipped with pulley station), Nitro Crossing (challenges participant to swing from one side to another), Mohawk Walk (a station structured with cables to balance from one side to another) and many other stations. The Park is ideal for team building sessions or adventurous activities such as orientation and leadership programmes for many organisations.

The CC also has a womenâ€™s soccer team and actively organises various soccer activities for women in the community. This helps to forge friendship and bring the women in the divison together.

There are also many attractive courses for residents. These include yoga and stretching classes as well as courses conducted by the Pottery Club.

Some of our interest groups include PLK Paddlers, a mixed dragon boat team made up of people from all walks of life and a Tchoukball Interest Group. Over the last two years, the PLK Paddlers has done the CC proud, having won the Northeast Dragon Boat Championships, PA Paddles Championship All Stars as well as the Aljunied GRC Championship.
