Jurong Green Community Club is a hub for art and music lovers. The Mus’Art Wind Orchestra (MWO), formed in 1998 under the wing of the CC regularly brings its music into the heartlands during festive periods, in addition to its various concert hall performances. The MWO, which has more than 60 members, has won several awards at the World Music Contest (WMC); including a Gold award (in the 1st division) at the 16th WMC (2009) in Kerkrade, the Netherlands, a Gold award (2nd division) at the 15th WMC (2005) and a 2nd prize (in the 3rd division) at the 14th WMC.

The Yilin Art Club, which attracts art enthusiasts, organises a major art exhibition every two years featuring works by well-known local and overseas artistes as well as students. Tea lovers are welcome to join the tea appreciation club where members gather twice a week for tea appreciation activities.

Jurong Green CC also holds the honour of being the very first CC to have a McDonald’s outlet co-located within the building.
