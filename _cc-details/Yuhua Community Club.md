### Yuhua Community Club

The Yuhua CC building has a unique Oriental structure which depicts the Asian culture. The building is also co-located with the Jurong East NPC.

The CC is known for our Recycling Collection Day on the second Sunday of every month and the Annual Health Screening programme to help out residents.

For sports enthusiasts, Table- Tennis Tables, Basketball and Petanque Courts are also available at the CC and the CC has a strong Pickleball Interest Group and Senior Citizen’s Brisk Walk Group that regularly packs in some 200 participants.
