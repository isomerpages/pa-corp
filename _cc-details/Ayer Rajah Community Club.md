At first glance, Ayer Rajah CC looks like a very normal CC. Hidden away on the rooftop of the three-storey building, however, is a beautiful garden, where you can enjoy the evening breeze surrounded by greenery. The bonsais found in the garden are taken care of by an interest group which meets every Friday. Also within the CC are two ponds where koi fishes are reared.

Other than the usual facilities, the CC is built to be barrier-free and designed to provide greater accessibility for the disabled and the elderly. In addition, they also offer day care services for senior citizens.

Whether you want to join our activity or be part of our bonsai interest group or just want to feed the fishes, visit us!.
