### Nanyang Community Club

Everybody recognizes the Nanyang CC by its four-faced clock tower. The roof top of the landmark CC is actually a multi-purpose function area where residents can enjoy a pleasant view of Nanyang. It is an ideal place for social gatherings.

Other than its wide range of courses and facilities, Nanyang CC also has community gardens (vegetable and herbal gardens) for nature lovers. The gardens are maintained by residents and grassroots leaders.

Fitness buffs can enjoy Awin's People's-Contours Express Womenâ€™s Gym at the CC.
