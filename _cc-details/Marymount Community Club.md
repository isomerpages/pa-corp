### Marymount Community Club

The first thing strikes you about Marymount CC is its cosiness, and the warmth served up by its friendly volunteers and staff. Too lazy to travel to the beach? Marymount CC has a real beach volleyball court right in the middle of the heartlands - complete with sand and sometimes, hunks and babes.

Marymount CC offers you:

Bishan Active (along Bishan St 22): A heartland park that features a beach volleyball court, basketball court, a soccer field and a range of other fitness facilities.
To book a facility or find out more about the available facilities or services, please contact the CC.
