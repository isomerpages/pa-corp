### Kolam Ayer Community Club

Talk about Kolam Ayer CC and you will think of the Kolam Ayer Performing Art Cultural Troupe (KAyPACT). KAyPACT is made up of 40 multi-cultural dancers and led by a team of three choreographers - Mr Ranjit Singh, Ms Mazlina Buang and Ms Cindy Loh. They work together regularly to choreograph dances which are performed by KAyPACT. Together with the group of dedicated dancers from the Kolam Ayer Community Club (CC) – the Bhangre D Sitare, the Atrika Dancers and the Chinese Cultural Dance Group – KAy PACT has created a unique fusion dance called Unity In Diversity, in celebration of our diverse culture.

Most of the dancers of KAy PACT are residents of Kolam Ayer. Their ages range from 8 to 36 years old. They spend every Saturday practicing together at the CC. Many of them have been with KAy PACT since the troupe was formed in 2000.

Kolam Ayer is home to an Elvis Fan Club whose members meet regularly. Fans of the late Elvis Presley would definitely have much to talk about when they join this interest group.

The CC also offers popular courses such as Belly Dancing, Bhangra Dance and Pilates. There is also a Dhol workshop for those interested in picking up Punjabi Drumming.
