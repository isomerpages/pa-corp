### Pasir Ris Elias Community Club

The Pasir Elias CC offers residents an archery range on Level 4 as well as a roof terrace, while a hardcourt in front of the CC is often host to many community activities.

We are proud to have a Chinese Orchestra Group, consisting mainly of residents in the Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, and a Jazz Band, both which perform regularly in various local events.

The Elias Park Football Club, managed by the CC, won the North East Racial Harmony Soccer Tournament 2009 (in the Under-13 category) and the Punggol Central Soccer Fiesta 7-a-side Soccer Tournament (in the Under-16 category).
