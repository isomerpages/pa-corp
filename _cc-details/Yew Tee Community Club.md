### Yew Tee Community Club

Yew Tee CC is co-located with Chua Chu Kang Neighbourhood Police Centre, educational institutes, student care and a fast-food joint.

Residents can enjoy a fantastic view of the skyline overlooking Yew Tee from the CC’s rooftop terrace, where many activities are held.

Those looking for a cosy and warmly-lit place for small gatherings and marriage solemnisations can consider the CC’s lounge, which comes complete with comfortable sofas and a fully-equipped sound system.
