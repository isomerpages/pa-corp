### Toa Payoh South Community Club

Toa Payoh South CC (formerly known as Kim Keat CC) is located in the eastern part of Toa Payoh, at the edge of the Kim Keat estate. It is one of the few CCs with an indoor squash court.

It is home to the Kim Keat Community Centre Lion & Dragon Dance Troupe, which was founded in 1978. The troupe has consistently taken part in various performances, locally and overseas. The CC also conducts Yamaha Music School classes for kids. For those interested in Ballet and Modern Jazz, the CC has been working with Kavangh Dance School to offer the Commonwealth School of Teachers of Dancing \[Australia\] (C.S.T.D.) dance syllabi catered for both the young and old.
