Geylang West CC is a 10-minute walk from Kallang MRT Station.

There is bound to be something for you among our 20 interests groups including Qi Gong, Badminton, Cantonese Opera, Folk Dance, Dikir Barat, Social Dance and Pickle Ball.

The Happy Arts Performing Group at the CC is one of a kind. The friendly all-inclusive group is made up of members of different races (Malay, Chinese, Indian and Eurasian), from ages 5 to 93 years. It also has members who are physically challenged. Tapping on its diversity as its strength, the group performs in festive events and at old folks' homes and hospitals. In 2005, members of the group were crowned Champions in the Senior Talent Group Star Search 2005.
