### MacPherson Community Club
The MacPherson CC has a ‘Time Capsule’ displayed prominently in front of the multi-purpose hall. It contains many items contributed by the different communities, which captures the community values and spirit to be imparted to future generations of MacPherson residents. The capsule was introduced in December 2008 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of MacPherson constituency. It will be opened in 2028.
