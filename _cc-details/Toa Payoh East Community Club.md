### Toa Payoh East Community Club

Toa Payoh East CC was formerly known as Boon Teck Community Centre. That was before it underwent upgrading in 1997. Its name change came on 1 February 1997 due to changes in electoral boundaries.

The CC has introduced many interesting courses such as Capoeira, a Brazilian form of Martial Art, and also Geikiken, a form of Japanese Swordsmanship.

The social and recreational activities and educational tours organised by the CC are also very well received. These allow participants to learn new things as well as make new friends.
