Within walking distance of Marsiling MRT station, the Fuchun CC captures the imagination of visitors with its elegant garden, pavilion and pond situated right in the centre of the CC. At the CC, you can learn to make delicious cookies, cakes and pies for your family. You can also learn the basics of hair cutting, magic tricks and balloon twisting.

The CC’s Marsiling Chinese Orchestra (MCO) helps to the appreciation of Chinese traditional music among the young. It has 120 young talents, five of whom are Malays.

The Fuchun Malay Activity Executive Committee (MAEC) on the other hand, actively promotes dance among the residents. Its dance troupe, Persadaku Seni represented Singapore at the Dance Xchange 2009 held in the Philippines.

The CC also manages the Mega Sports Park situated opposite Blk 336, Woodlands Ave 1, which is popular among residents.
