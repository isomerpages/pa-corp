### Tampines Central Community Club @ Our Tampines Hub

The Tampines Central Community Club was originally located in a Civil Defence shelter back in 1997. From its humble beginnings to the current building complex, the community club’s objective has not changed. Besides being a key meeting point for residents, the community club is also an integral tool in fostering a strong “Kampung Sprit” within Tampines Central.
