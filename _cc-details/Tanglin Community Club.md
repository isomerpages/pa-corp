### Tanglin Community Club

An impressive clock tower and the attractive white façade help stamp a unique identity on Tanglin Community Club.

For traditional Chinese music lovers, it is the only CC to offer a Guzheng course. The CC also holds various martial arts classes such as Arnis, Ju-Jitsu, Silat, Muay Thai and the hugely popular Aikido course.

The CC’s active DanzBuddies club organises a monthly Line Dance party, giving members a wonderful opportunity to socialise with fellow dance aficionados.
