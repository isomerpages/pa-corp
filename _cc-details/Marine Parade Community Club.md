### Marine Parade Community Club

You can’t miss the Marine Parade CC, which is “clad” in a huge wall mural, a commissioned work of art by Thai architect Surachai Yeamsiri. The mural, called the “Texturefulness of Life” is Singapore’s largest piece of installation art, measuring 63 metres by 12 metres, and covers the curved north- and east-facing façade of the CC.

The CC is home to the Marine Parade Community Library as well as The Necessary Stage - the first arts group to be housed within a community club. Residents also enjoy a 263-seat theatrette, a roof terrace for gatherings, as well as music, study and activity rooms.

Those wishing to know the rich history of Marine Parade can visit the CC’s Heritage Centre, located on the 2nd level of the CC.
