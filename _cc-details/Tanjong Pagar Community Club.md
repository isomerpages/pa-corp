### Tanjong Pagar Community Club

Tanjong Pagar CC specialises in arts and ceramic courses which are conducted in the CC’s Pottery Workshop and Arts Studios. The CC also has its own kiln so that participants are able to make and take home their creation. In addition, it is the only CC to offer "finger-painting" courses.
