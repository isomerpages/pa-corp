#### Woodlands Galaxy Community Club

Woodlands Galaxy Community Club is a short walk away from Admiralty MRT station and Woodlands Admiral Garden.

The CC has a unique Yummy Yummy Club where the Women’s Executive Committee (WEC) members take turns to share various cooking recipes with residents. There is also a Mahjong Club where residents exchange tips on the game every second Saturday of the month. For movie buffs, regular film screenings are organised by the CC\*.

_\* Please check with CC on movie schedules and show times._
