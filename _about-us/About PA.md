### About Us

The People’s Association (PA) was established on 1 July 1960 as a statutory board to promote racial harmony and social cohesion in Singapore. Our mission is to build and bridge communities in achieving one people, one Singapore.

PA offers a wide range of programmes to cater to Singaporeans from all walks of life - connecting people to people, and people and government. We do this through our network of over 2,000 grassroots organisations (GROs), over 100 Community Clubs, five Community Development Councils, National Community Leadership Institute and PAssion WaVe.

### Vision for the Community

*   Share our Values

Bringing People Together

### Our Logo

<img style="width:150px" align="center" src="/images/About%20Us/PA%20Logo%20no%20brand%20name.jpg">

The People's Association's (PA) logo is made up of one continuous element. This represents the PA's mission of connecting Singaporeans from all ethnic backgrounds to promote active citizenry and multiracial harmony

Different communities, represented by the circles, keep their distinct identities and cultural values while moving and interacting with one another in the common space. Our vision is one of all communities bonding closely together, increasing the common space and strengthening the nation.


### Our Flag
