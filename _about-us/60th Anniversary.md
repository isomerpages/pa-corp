2020 marks 60 years of community building with our people. We have walked this journey with fellow Singaporeans to build a harmonious, multi-racial and multi-cultural community.

The road ahead is not without challenges, but a strong and united community creates possibilities for Singapore to respond to these challenges, seize new opportunities and make things happen.

At the heart of this community are our grassroots leaders, volunteers, community partners and residents. Together, we re-imagine our common future, co-create opportunities and build a strong and united community for many more decades to come.

#### **Community Values**
Singapore is a multi-cultural nation and we stay united because we share common values that hold us together, and give us our confidence and commitment to the future of our Home.

##### Care and Courage

We show and demonstrate care. We believe that it is important to do what is right for our people.
