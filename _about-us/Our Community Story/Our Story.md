<p>This is our story, but also yours.</p>
<p>It’s a story that started back in 1960. Singapore was newly independent,
full of untapped potential, but facing our first challenges as a nation.
Unrest brewed as we clashed over differing views and beliefs, and the road
ahead of us was uncertain. To ensure our survival, we needed someone, or
something, to rally the people, hear our needs, and provide a safe platform
for all to come together, no matter our differences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response, the People’s Association (PA) was formed on 1st July 1960
to foster racial harmony and social cohesion, and build a bridge between
the government and the people. We began simply, gathering families around
black and white TV sets in our Community Centres, or offering classes where
people could meet and mingle with one another.</p>
<p>As Singapore grew and changed, so did the PA. When National Service was
introduced, grassroots leaders helped to reassure families and ease worries.
And when kampungs transformed into the HDB estates we now call home, we
invited neighbours to volunteer in Residents’ Committees, working together
to carry the spirit of togetherness from our past to the present.</p>
<p>Time and again, during crises like SARS and Covid-19, we saw this spirit
in action. Grassroots volunteers, neighbours, and strangers came together
to care for those in need, delivering food, checking on one another, and
offering a helping hand. These moments showed us that Singapore isn’t just
a country we happen to reside in — it’s our home, where we contribute to
our community, stay connected, and care for each other.</p>
<p>Our hopes and dreams have changed over the years, along with a sense of
growing responsibility — a desire to give back, and to be part of something
bigger than ourselves. We’re no longer just living in our neighbourhoods;
we’re the ones who can make them better.</p>
<p>We’re excited to keep nurturing this spirit. While the PA’s role has evolved
over the decades, our purpose has not — we continue to foster social cohesion
by creating opportunities for this spirit to flourish, be it organising
events, launching initiatives, or developing partnerships through our network
of spaces and associations such as lifestyle hubs, community centres/clubs,
and grassroots organisations. Beyond that, we’re also here to spark ideas,
support those who step forward, and help nurture seeds of care. We want
to help you participate in your community by connecting, collaborating,
and creating change — not just for today, but for the generations to come.</p>
<p>The Singapore we imagine is a place where every person feels that they
have a role to play in their neighbourhood, where participating in our
communities just becomes part of daily life. It’s not about grand gestures
or heroic efforts — it’s the simple, genuine acts that ripple through a
community and make it stronger. It could be about going the extra mile
to take ownership of your neighbourhood, such as by formal volunteering,
sharing feedback on government policies and schemes, or leading an initiative
that could help with community needs. It could also be small, seemingly
mundane moments of care, like simply taking the time to check in on your
elderly neighbour.</p>
<p>This story is about all of us —&nbsp;coming together, sharing our strengths,
and building a future where care and unity are at the core of who we are.
A future where every contribution adds up to something greater; where community
isn’t just a word but a living, breathing reality.</p>
