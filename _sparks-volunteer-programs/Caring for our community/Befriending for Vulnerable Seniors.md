						TOUCH Active Ageing (TAA)&nbsp;empowers seniors to lead fulfilling lives as they learn to stay physically active and socially connected. We believe that every senior - regardless of their age, ability or physical status - can be to help others. For seniors with low or no social support, TAA will partner with volunteers to visit these seniors regularly.

We are looking for volunteers to befriend seniors and their caregivers by providing social support through regular visits, phone calls and engagement.&nbsp;
