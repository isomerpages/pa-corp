<h2>People's Association to Train 1,000 Community Facilitators from 2026 to Build "We First" Society</h2>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The People’s Association (PA) today launched its new Community Facilitators
Programme, in support of Singapore’s efforts to build a “We First” society.
The new programme was announced at the 60th anniversary dinner of its apex
grassroots organisation, the Citizens’ Consultative Committees (CCCs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Guest-of-Honour was Chairman of PA, Prime Minister and Minister for
Finance Lawrence Wong. Mr Edwin Tong, Deputy Chairman of PA, Minister for
Law and Second Minister for Home Affairs, joined Prime Minister with 1,200
Grassroots Advisers and CCC grassroots leaders at the event to recognise
the efforts of the CCCs which have been vital to Singapore’s nation-building
efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the moment Singapore gained independence, the CCCs were instrumental
in addressing the challenges facing the fledgling nation and serving as
a vital bridge between the people and the Government. Without a military
of its own, the CCCs helped to explain why Singapore needed National Service
and built public support for this significant new policy. The CCCs played
a crucial role in persuading kampung residents to relocate to new housing
estates, whilst assisting with housing applications and administrative
processes, to free up land for Singapore’s development. Today, CCCs plan
and lead major grassroots initiatives within constituencies, oversee local
assistance programmes, and organise fundraising projects and national campaigns,
thus ensuring every Singaporean feels a sense of belonging and care within
their community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of its continued efforts to build a "We First" society, PA will
train 1,000 volunteers as skilled community facilitators through its new
Community Facilitators Programme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From 2026, PA will partner Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to systematically
train community facilitators, starting with the CCCs, ensuring every constituency
has leaders equipped with advanced training in community engagement and
facilitation skills. These skills will enable grassroots leaders to identify
the strengths and interests that already exist in their community and help
residents connect and collaborate around what they care about. Residents
can look forward to more engagement sessions across constituencies, at
more accessible locations closer to residents, offering them more meaningful
opportunities to shape their communities and contribute to Singapore’s
shared future.</p>
