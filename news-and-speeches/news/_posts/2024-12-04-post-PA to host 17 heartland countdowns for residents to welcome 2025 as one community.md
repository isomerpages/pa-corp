<h2>People’s Association to organise 17 heartland countdown celebrations for residents to welcome 2025 as one community</h2>
<p>The People’s Association Grassroots Organisations (PA GROs) will organise
17 heartland countdown celebrations on Tuesday, 31 December 2024, with
each site having fun-filled engaging activities, for residents to usher
in the New Year nearer to home. The heartland celebrations, which are part
of ONE Countdown 2025 to kick off SG60 celebrations, aim to bring families
and friends together to celebrate, reflect, and share their resolutions
for the New Year.</p>
<p>2 Organised by about 1,700 grassroots leaders and community volunteers
– from dedicated students, working professionals, to seasoned seniors –
who are eager to make a difference in their communities, the 17 heartland
countdown celebrations promise to offer vibrant and inclusive programmes
that bring joy and celebration to people of all ages. These events bring
the spirit of unity, volunteerism, and community engagement.</p>
<p>3 Families can look forward to artistic experiences such as mural painting
and exploring an interactive media art installation wall at Nee Soon Countdown
2025. At Illuminate 2025, that will be held at Bedok Stadium, residents
can co-create a community artwork with renowned graffiti artist, Zero.</p>
<p>4 For those seeking sporting fun, Tampines Boogie Countdown to 2025 will
feature K-pop random dance sessions led by various dance interest groups
in Our</p>
<p>Tampines Hub. Seniors can showcase their moves at a lively dance party
at Holland-Bukit Timah GRC and Bukit Panjang SMC Year-End Countdown Celebrations
@ Heartlands 2024. Residents can also enjoy sport try-outs conducted by
ActiveSG at various heartland celebrations which include giant human bowling,
zig zag golf, and inflatable archery.</p>
<p>5 This year, community participation is at the heart of the 17 heartland
countdown celebrations. At MY Countdown, that will be held at Woodlands
Stadium, a pop-up musical instrument exhibition will feature at least 15
traditional instruments contributed by volunteers, and residents will have
the opportunity to try out these instruments. Meanwhile, about 100 students
from River Valley High School will play a key role in Boon Lay Countdown
2025 - Be The Spark. A New Start, serving as planners and facilitators
for the engagement booths at the event.</p>
<p>6 Over at Aljunied and Hougang, residents have come together to fold 2,025
origami cranes as blessings for the upcoming New Year, and their efforts
will be showcased at Igniting Sparks of Hope. In addition, Tanjong Pagar
GRC &amp; Radin Mas SMC Countdown New-tro Night will feature an art piece,
created from quilling materials contributed by residents, which symbolises
community participation and the unique story of individuality.</p>
<p>7 Members of the public can approach their nearby Community Clubs, Residents’
Committees, Neighbourhood Committees, and Residents’ Networks for more
information on the events.</p>
