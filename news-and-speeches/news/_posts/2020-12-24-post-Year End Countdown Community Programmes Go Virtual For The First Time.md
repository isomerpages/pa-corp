**Description**: 

As 2020 comes to a close and we approach Phase 3 of Re-opening, we need to remain vigilant particularly during festive periods. Residents have always looked forward to our rousing community year-end countdown programmes which attract large crowds, including families. This year, our year-end countdown community programmes will go virtual for the first time as we continue to stay connected with each other. Residents will find many exciting programmes put together by the constituencies organising committees comprising volunteers and staff. They took the past months to plan and bring programme novelties in a safe way as families enjoy them virtually in the comfort of their homes. 
 
There will be 16 virtual engagement programmes lined up at the various constituencies.  At the Bedok Countdown virtual event, residents can look forward to a silent disco and participate in penning down New Year wishes for themselves and the nation. Over at Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC Virtual Countdown 2021, there will be a good mix of celebrity emcee and local musicians performing live. Residents can also participate in the "MY Favourite 2020 Family Moment Contest" to share their most memorable moments of the year. At the 2021 Countdown@Nanyang, other than live band performances and interactive games, families will be invited online to share their experiences during COVID and their wishes for 2021. Several of the virtual programmes will end off with a live streaming of fireworks – symbolising our hopes and aspirations as we come together as one community to reflect and look forward to a united and stronger 2021. Refer to Annexes for more information.  
 
We hope that residents can join our virtual programmes online and come together as a community to reflect the past and look forward to the new year with hope, optimism and confidence.
