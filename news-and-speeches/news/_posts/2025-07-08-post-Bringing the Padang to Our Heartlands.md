<h3>Bringing the Padang to Our Heartlands: Singaporeans To Enjoy National Day Festivities in Their Communities at the NDP 2025 Heartland Celebrations</h3>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Singaporeans can look forward to continuing the National Day festivities
on Sunday, 10 August 2025 at the Heartlands. Together with the People’s
Association (PA), the National Day Parade (NDP) 2025 Executive Committee
will bring crowd favourites such as the Mobile Column, Fighter Island Flypast
and the Red Lions1 from the Padang to five Heartlands locations, bringing
the festivities closer to Singaporeans. Each Heartland site will also have
exciting family-friendly activities co-created by PA and its grassroots
organisations with volunteers and partners. There will also be exhibits,
Mobile Column static display, live performances and a grand finale with
fireworks and a drone show.</p>

<p>Co-Chairman of the NDP 2025 Heartland Celebrations Committee Colonel David
Kwek said, “In addition to expanding this year’s NDP from the Padang to
the Marina Bay area as a seamless canvas, it is our hope that we can bring
the spirit of National Day to as many Singaporeans as possible, into their
homes and neighbourhoods. Together with PA, the NDP 2025 Executive Committee
will be bringing the Padang to our Heartlands so that more Singaporeans
can enjoy the National Day festivities.”</p>

<p>Mr Pow Choon Ghee, Co-Chairman of the NDP 2025 Heartland Celebrations
Committee and PA Group Director (Grassroots) said: “This year, Singapore
turns 60 – and the celebrations are coming to your neighbourhood. In a
ground-up effort led by People’s Association and our Grassroots Organisations,
together with passionate volunteers and community partners, a rich line-up
of heartland programmes has been co-created to bring people together in
meaningful ways. From immersive installations and community art projects
to family-friendly activities and electrifying performances, there’s something
for everyone – young and old. Join us in the heartlands as we celebrate
Singapore’s 60th birthday — not just as individuals, but as One Community”.</p>

<p>The NDP 2025 Mobile Column will be returning to the Heartlands for SG60
this year. Speaking about its return, Chairman of the NDP 2025 Mobile Column
to Heartlands Committee Lieutenant-Colonel Chek Wei Lun, said, “60 Vehicles
from the Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team will travel to the heartland
sites through five routes, and Singaporeans will be able to experience
the mobile column up close. To expand the reach of NDP celebrations this
year, the Mobile Column will stop at designated pit stops along each route,
which would be open to the public for the first time for them to view the
vehicles. Singaporeans can also track the live location of the Mobile Column
via the NDP website, allowing them to anticipate when their favourite vehicles
would pass through their estates.”</p>

<p>*Red Lions will conduct their signature display jump at the Bishan site
only.</p>

<li>
<p>The Fighter Island Flypast will involve four F-16s fighters flying in
a diamond</p>
<p>formation through the heartlands of Singapore from 6pm to 6.30pm. They
will be flying</p>
<p>each loop twice to provide our residents more opportunities to catch a
glimpse of them.</p>
<p>6. Residents can look forward to celebrating National Day with unique
community experiences. In Central Singapore, residents will help create
a grand SG60 installation using 600 Singapore-themed puzzle pieces. In
the North East, residents will come together to illuminate vibrant lanterns
and share their well wishes through glowing message bottles. The North
West will showcase community-created artwork of local landmarks. South
East residents can look forward to the Rink of Light skating experience.
The South West District will feature floating lanterns with residents'
well wishes. More details can be found in PA’s fact sheet.</p>
