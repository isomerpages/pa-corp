**Description:**

Residents of Singapore will be able to collect an improved version of reusable masks as part of the third mask collection exercise. Residents with a valid identification card can collect one reusable mask each over a three-week period as follows: 

From 26 May to 1 June 2020 (10am to 6pm) from the counter at all CCs and RC Centres. 

From 26 May to 14 June 2020 (Open 24hrs) from vending machines at all CCs. 

There will be two mask sizes available for collection – adult size and kid size. The kid size masks, which are suitable for children 12 years old and below, are produced by Ramatex in collaboration with A*STAR, while the adult size masks are by Ghim Li in collaboration with Nanyang Technological University. Both types of reusable masks are made of at least three layers of material and have a filtration efficiency of at least 95 per cent, even after 30 washes. New materials have also been used for these masks to improve their resistance to droplets and comfort for the users.  Priority of the kids masks will be allocated to children 12 years old and below. As such, adult identity cards will only be able to collect adult size masks while the identity documents for children 12 years old and below will be able to collect either an adult or kid size mask.  

Temasek Foundation has provided 400 vending machines to all the CCs across Singapore, offering convenience to residents who may not be able to collect the masks from the CCs and RC Centres during operating hours. The vending machine is simple to use. Residents can refer to the instructional guide, available in four different languages, attached on every machine for the three easy steps to collect the mask.  

The exercise is also supported by RedeemSG, a mobile app and system developed by Open Government Products, a division under GovTech. The app allows government officers and volunteers to track the redemption of goods, vouchers and tickets. For this round of mask distribution, PA staff and volunteers will record who has redeemed their mask to ensure that every resident is able to receive their mask allocation. 

MINDEF and the SAF continued to support this third national mask distribution exercise. The SAF assisted in breaking bulk and transporting the reusable masks to the CCs across Singapore. Around 150 SAF servicemen and about 40 military vehicles were involved in this collaborative effort.  

To avoid crowding at the collection points, we encourage one family member to collect the masks on behalf of their whole household. They have to bring along their family members’ NRICs, Birth Certificate or any government-issued identification with barcode.  

Safe distancing measures and temperature taking will be implemented at all CCs and RC Centres to ensure the safety and well-being of our residents, volunteers and staff.  

For the safety and well-being of residents, all the high-touch areas on the vending machines are treated with self-disinfecting coating, which can last for three months. The vending machines will also be cleaned and restocked regularly.  

Residents can visit MaskGoWhere website (www.maskgowhere.gov.sg) set up by GovTech, for the latest information on the mask collection exercise. Residents can also check the availability of the masks in the vending machines via MaskGoWhere website before making their way down to collect. Alternatively, residents can refer to community notice boards, digital display panels, or their local CC social media channels for more information on the mask collection exercise
