<h3>Prime Minister And Minister For Finance Lawrence Wong Launches Pa Youth Charter To Empower Youths To Build A Caring And United Singapore</h3>
<p><em>PA launches SG60 PA Engagement Grant while PA Youth Movement pledges 1 million volunteer hours to spark and nurture community participation.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Prime Minister and Minister for Finance,<strong> </strong>Lawrence
Wong will launch the PA Youth Charter at the Future of Youth on 1 March
2025, 3pm at Ngee Ann City, Civic Plaza.&nbsp; The PA Youth Charter serves
to energise and catalyse more youth-led ground-up action and rally youth
to take the lead to shape the society that they envision in Singapore’s
next bound.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PA Youth Charter
articulates the consensus and commitments crystallised from 127,000 voices
of youth from all walks of life. &nbsp;This builds on the engagement that
was done in the Forward Singapore exercise to refresh the youth social
compact with the Government and understand the changing aspirations of
youth today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Future of YOUth is organised
by the PA Youth Movement (PAYM). &nbsp;PM Wong will be &nbsp;accompanied
by Mr Edwin Tong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, Second Minister
for Law and Deputy Chairman of People’s Association, and Dr Janil Puthucheary,
Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Digital Development and Information
&amp; Ministry of Health and Chairman of Panel of Advisers to PAYM Council,
as well as Ms Nadia Samdin and Mr Xie Yao Quan, Members of Panel of Advisers
to PAYM Council.</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past 15
months, through the FutureYOUth Movement, the PAYM engaged widely and deeply
through multi-modal engagements – 212 conversations, focus group discussions,
engagements and listening posts on three issues that youths resonate with
- (a) Mental Health, (b) Racial and Religious Harmony and (c) Sustainability
&amp; Environment. This organic ground-up initiative led by youths, for
youths, saw deep engagement across diverse youth segments.</p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The FutureYOUth
Movement goes beyond the number of voices. It is about the mindset and
determination of young people wanting to take charge of their future. The
PA Youth Charter reflects the diverse tapestry of dreams and aspirations
of youths to build a better Singapore. The launch of the PA Youth Charter
serves as a call to action for youths to harness their passion, be active
changemakers and drive positive change in their communities.</p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chairman of Panel
of Advisers to PAYM Council Dr Janil Puthucheary said:<strong> “</strong>The
value of PAYM’s outreach is not just 127,000 youth voices, it is the depth
and quality of the voices, leveraging&nbsp; community touchpoints through
our networks and networks of partners, the Institutes of Higher Learning
and schools including the madrasahs, uniformed groups, cause-based groups,
the youth wings of faith-based organisations, and then going a step further,
engaging with voices less likely to be heard - persons with disabilities
and incarcerated youth in reformative training.”</p>
<p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To support Youth Networks’ and youths’ efforts to build connections between
Singaporeans, PA introduced the new SG60 PA Engagement Grant. The grant
amount of $3,000 serves as a catalyst to spark more community engagement
and participation. The 95 youth networks from the PAYM will serve as the
natural receptacle that like-minded youths and organisations can work with
to bring their ideas into reality and drive social change in the local
community and neighbourhood.</p>
<p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The PA Youth Movement
(PAYM) is also committing 1 million volunteer hours this year to spark
and nurture community participation and sustain youth-driven projects in
the community. PAYM wants to energise and mobilise fellow youths and young
organisations to act, to care for one another, the community and their
environment.</p>
<p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; At “The Future of YOUth”
event, youth leaders from PA Youth Networks, together with their community
partners will share with Prime Minister their ground-up projects and initiatives
at the “Community Village”. Chairman of Zhenghua YN, Arunraj, shared that
youths taking a proactive approach is vital for true resilience. Collaborating
with aspiring students, he looks forward to introducing the “Posture Buddy”
initiative to help young children improve posture and promote mental well-being.</p>
