### Phase 1 of Post-Circuit Breaker 

**Summary**: 

We will enter Phase 1 of post-Circuit Breaker from June 2. The public is advised to stay home to minimise the spread of COVID-19. Everyone should continue to leave home only for essential activities. If they need to exercise (walk, jog or cycle) outside, they should exercise in their immediate neighbourhood, including a park or a park connector near them, either alone or only with other individuals of the same household.

**Description**: 

With the Circuit Breaker ending on 1 June 2020, Singapore will take a phased approach in safely resuming activities, progressively lifting Circuit Breaker measures over three phases. 
 
From 2 June 2020, Phase One will mark the safe re-opening of some activities which do not pose high risk of transmission. Social, economic and entertainment activities that carry higher risk will remain closed. Residents are encouraged to remain vigilant and only leave their homes for essential activities, wearing a mask if doing so. Seniors are also advised to continue to stay at home as much as possible. 
 
These re-opening plans will not be a return to life before COVID-19. We must get used to a new normal, where we continue the widespread adoption of safe management measures and technology so we can carry out our daily activities safely.

Let's continue to be socially responsible and mindful of others in our community.
