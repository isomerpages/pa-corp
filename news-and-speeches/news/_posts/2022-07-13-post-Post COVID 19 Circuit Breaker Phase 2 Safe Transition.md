**Description**: 

As we enter Phase Two (Safe Transition) of post-Circuit Breaker on Friday, 19 June 2020, programmes and activities at the Community Centres/Clubs (CCs) and other PA facilities will progressively resume in a limited way with safe management measures in place. This is for the safety and well-being of the members of the public, our volunteers and staff.  Residents’ Committee Centres will remain closed. 

From 19 June 2020, CCs will open daily except on public holidays. Operating hours are as follows: 

 

For CCs 

* Facilities open from 10:00am to 10:00pm (closed on public holidays)

The CCs will progressively resume its programmes and courses in a limited way. In accordance with safe management measures, class sizes will be controlled with no more than five people in a group. We encourage residents to continue to stay healthy and active through PA’s digital programmes and webinars, which are easily accessible on social media platforms. Interested residents can sign up for PA courses and programmes through www.onepa.sg  

Booking of sports facilities such as badminton halls and gyms will also resume, with certain limits put in place in accordance to SportSG guidelines. The limits include individuals having to maintain a distance of two-metre from each other at all times, no more than five people in a group and a capacity cap at the premises.  

Other PA facilities such as PAssion WaVe outlets and IMPACT@Hong Lim Green will be open for booking of selected facilities and courses. More information will be available on their respective Facebook pages. 

Participants who have queries on the status of their courses or interest group activities may contact their respective CCs.
