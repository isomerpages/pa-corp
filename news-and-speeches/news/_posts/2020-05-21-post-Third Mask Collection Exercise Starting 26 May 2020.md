**Description**: 

Residents will be able to collect an improved version of reusable masks as part of the third mask collection exercise. Residents with a valid identification card can collect one reusable mask each: 

From 26 May to 1 June 2020 (10am to 6pm) from the counter at all CCs and RC Centres. 

From 26 May to 14 June 2020 (Open 24hrs) from vending machines at all CCs. 

There will be two mask sizes available for collection – adult size and kid size. Priority of the kids masks will be allocated to children 12 years old and below. As such, residents with adult identity cards will only be able to collect adult size masks while those with identity documents for children 12 years old and below will be able to collect either an adult or kid size mask.  
 
Safe distancing measures and temperature taking will be implemented at all CCs and RC Centres to ensure the safety and well-being of our residents, volunteers and staff. Residents are reminded to wear a mask when leaving their homes.
