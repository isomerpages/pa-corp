           As 2022 comes to a close, residents can look forward to more than **20 community celebrations** held physically at various locations around their neighbourhoods on 31 December 2022 to usher in the new year. These celebrations, organised by the **People’s Association Grassroots Organisations** (PA GROs), will bring together over **70,000 residents** of all ages, races, and nationalities to bond with families, friends, and neighbours as well as share their wishes and aspirations for 2023. This is the first time such physical year-end countdown festivities have resumed in the heartlands since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.   

          Residents can join in the many exciting programmes organised by volunteers and staff from the constituencies organising committees that reflect the diverse interests of Singaporeans as they enjoy the festive cheer and welcome the new year together as a community. Key highlights of the islandwide year-end celebrations include stage performances, interactive games, carnivals and food trucks, movie screenings and dazzling laser effects and fireworks displays. One Punggol will host its **first** year-end community countdown celebration “**Countdown to 2023 @ One Punggol”** for Punggol residents. Tampines residents can party the night away at **“That Night @ OTH”** from 31 December 2022 to 2 January 2023. They will be entertained by the circus-themed countdown show **‘Countdown to Magical Moments’ 2023 show**, festivities, and fireworks. At **“heARTs! @ Boon Lay 2023 - Boon Lay Countdown 2023”**, young residents have also stepped up to help plan and organise the year-end events, with a focus on inclusivity as they bring wheelchair bound residents and elderly to join in the celebration.

            The GROs have worked closely with the authorities to ensure that safety and security measures are in place for the countdown celebrations in the heartlands. In addition, staff and volunteers will be onsite to monitor and manage the crowd and ensure that the activities are carried out in a safe manner.
