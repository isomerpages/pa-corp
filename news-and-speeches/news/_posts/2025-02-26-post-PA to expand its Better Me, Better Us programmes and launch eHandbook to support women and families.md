<h3>People's Association to expand its "Better Me, Better Us" programmes and launch e-Handbook to support women and families</h3>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
People’s Association (PA) Women's Integration Network (WIN) Council and
Women's Executive Committees (WECs) are expanding its “Better Me, Better
Us” programmes to <strong>32</strong> this year, a 33 per cent increase from
the 24 programmes available in 2024. &nbsp;The PA “Better Me, Better Us”
Programmes, which connect women from different backgrounds to learn about
health, parenting, financial planning, and other important women’s issues,
was launched in 2020 with seven programmes and has been steadily growing
its programmes over the years.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To enable WECs to curate more
meaningful, tailored programmes that address the specific needs of women
and families in their respective divisions, PA is also launching its “Better
Me, Better Us” e-handbook.&nbsp; The PA “Better Me, Better Us” e-Handbook
exemplifies community-driven innovation, incorporated through invaluable
insights from the community and Women's Executive Committees (WECs).</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The expanded programmes and e-handbook will be launched by <strong>Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of National Development and Adviser to PA WIN Council, Ms Sim Ann, </strong>at
the WIN Council’s<strong> </strong>International Women’s Day Celebration
2025<strong>. </strong>The event, with the theme ‘<strong>Celebrate Women, Empower Women</strong>’,
will be held on Sunday, 2 March 2025 and is expected to attract about 500
participants from the WECs, partners and young women from other women’s
groups.</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ms Sim said, “We<em> want to empower women and families in the community through collaborations with the members of the public, organisations or agencies, to co-create programmes that help address the needs of women and families in different aspects of their lives. Through sharing information and personal experiences, we hope that participants can gain useful knowledge to enable them to take charge of their lives, connect with other women and families whom they can turn to for mutual support.&nbsp; They can come together to help spur one another on their journey</em>.”</p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the spirit of SG60, the
SG60 PA Engagement Grant will be made available to ground-up community
efforts this year. &nbsp;Partners and residents are invited to connect
and collaborate with PA’s WECs and Family Life Champions and tap on the
PA SG60 Grant to explore collaborative opportunities with new partners
and residents to develop impactful programmes for residents and community.
These programmes can then be incorporated into the PA “Better Me, Better
Us” e-handbook.</p>

<p><strong><u>PA “Better Me, Better Us” Programmes</u></strong>
</p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Covid-19 pandemic saw
women experiencing heightened stress and anxiety due to the challenges
of working from home and caring for their family. This affected their mental
and physical well-being, exacerbated by social isolation and their inability
to connect with peers face-to-face. To improve women’s well-being, connectedness
and foster learning together, PA WIN Council launched its “Better Me, Better
Us” programmes.</p>
<p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feedback to PA “Better Me,
Better Us” has been positive. Ms Diana Pang, Chairman of Fengshan WEC and
PA WIN Council, who organised the Financial Planning for Women for her
residents last year, said: “Many participants shared that the programmes
were very accessible for them, and found the knowledge they gained useful.
They also liked how our WEC programmes gave them a safe space for sharing
personal experiences.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Rabeeka Beevi, 38, a housewife,
who attended the Financial Planning workshop, said: “I am glad to have
attended the workshop as the speaker has shared good tips to help me understand
the importance of saving up for myself and family, and basics in growing
my savings.&nbsp; There was also a financial health clinic where there
is a coach for a one-to-one consultation which I found very useful to start
financial planning. I also made new friends among the fellow women who
attended the workshop, and we continue to keep in contact to share how
we are progressing in financial planning.&nbsp; I learnt how to save more
money which is beneficial to me and my family.”</p>

<p><strong><u>PA ‘Better Me, Better Us’ e-Handbook</u></strong>
</p>
<p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The e-handbook provides information on <strong>32</strong> programmes developed
in collaboration with partners including KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital,
Singapore Heart Foundation, Image Mission, Caregivers Alliance Limited
and Institute for Financial Literacy. &nbsp;Through the e-handbook, the
WECs can organise programmes for their residents and create opportunities
for them to contribute to the community by volunteering to impart their
knowledge to other residents or co-create support networks to continue
engagement.</p>
