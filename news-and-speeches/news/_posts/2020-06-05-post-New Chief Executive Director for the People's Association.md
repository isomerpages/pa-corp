Mr Tan was appointed CED, PA on 16 January 2017. During his tenure, Mr Tan led a number of strategic shifts in planning and operational capabilities to realise PA’s Community 2020 workplan. Notably, PA strengthened its Grassroots Movement, introducing Residents’ Networks to encourage greater social mixing, and Youth Networks to enable youths to engage more partners to serve their local communities. Under his leadership, PA reached out to different segments of the community through new initiatives, such as PAssion WaVe, ImPAct@Hong Lim Green, Wisma Geylang Serai, and other national programmes such as Merdeka Generation Package, Embracing Parenthood Movement and NS50.  Mr Tan also fostered greater networking and collaboration between PA and community organisations, corporate partners and other government agencies to better serve the community. He accelerated the adoption of technology under PA’s Digitalisation Roadmap, by making self-help terminals and mobile applications available to better serve residents. More recently, Mr Tan led PA’s ground operations as part of the whole-of-government COVID-19 response. These efforts included mask and hand sanitizer distribution exercises and Temporary Relief Fund application at the CCs and RCs, as well as supporting residents under Quarantine Order and Stay-Home-Notice.
