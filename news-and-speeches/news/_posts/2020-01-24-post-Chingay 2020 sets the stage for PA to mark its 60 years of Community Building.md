**Description**: 

PA marks its 60 years of community building this year. As a national platform which brings people from diverse backgrounds together to celebrate Singapore’s unique multi-culturalism, Chingay 2020 will be the first event to mark this significant milestone. 

The parade will be held on 31 January 2020, Friday and 1 February 2020, Saturday at the F1 Pit Building. 

Titled “Colours in Harmony”, Chingay 2020 will be a dynamic showcase of Singapore’s diversity and community spirit. 6,000 volunteer performers from all walks of life and from different organisations   are a part of this large-scale production. 

You can expect a spectacular line-up of visually engaging performances, which includes the debut of the world’s largest flying dragon and the release of firecrackers along the 200-metres parade route. 

An interesting fusion of old and new, where traditional art forms meet contemporary displays 

To commemorate the important milestone for PA, the parade will also feature a unique “Bridge of Harmony” float. It is decked out with “Harmony” tiles which are co-created by more than 20,000 residents island-wide, including those of different abilities and backgrounds. This signifies the shared journey of PA with fellow Singaporeans in community building.
