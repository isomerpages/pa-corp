<h2>People's Association's Seven Heartland Countdown Celebrations Bring Communities Together to Welcome 2026</h2>
<p></p>
<p>1. The People’s Association Grassroots Organisations (PA GROs) will organise
seven heartland countdown celebrations on Wednesday, 31 December 2025 for
residents to usher in the New Year with their friends and family nearer
to home as a community. PA’s heartland celebrations, which are part of
ONE Countdown 2026, will feature a wide range of family-centric activities
designed to bring residents together through shared experiences. The seven
countdown sites are Boon Lay, Keat Hong, Marsiling, Nee Soon, Punggol,
Tampines and Woodlands.</p>
<p>2. Organised and supported by about 700 grassroots leaders and community
volunteers, the activities at the heartland countdown celebrations are
curated to encourage residents to connect, contribute and care for one
another.</p>
<p>3. Music is one key highlight of this year’s heartland countdown celebrations
which brings together young and old residents. At Woodlands Waterfront
Countdown 2026, families can groove to a music-driven sober clubbing experience
with lively DJ performances, coffee and local snacks along the scenic Woodlands
Waterfront. Over at ‘Hearts @ Boon Lay, Building Brighter Futures!’, the
“Eras” Dance Floor will feature DJ-led, multilingual hits from the 60s
to today with the playlist shaped by community voting.</p>
<p>4. Beyond music, this year’s heartland celebrations will also feature
family fun, shared aspirations and community participation. Families with
young children can head down to Our Tampines Hub Countdown Celebrations
to 2026 to enjoy Pororo Kids Carnival which includes bookmark-making activity
and bouncing on Pororo-themed inflatable. For families with older children,
there are also e-sports try-outs and games for them to enjoy. At One Punggol
Year-End Countdown 2026, residents can enjoy performances such as harmonica
ensembles, karate demonstration and a thrilling fire circus before counting
down to the New Year.</p>
<p>5. At Nee Soon Countdown 2026 – Dare to Dream, residents can pen hopeful
messages in Postcard to My Future Self which will be mailed back next year
as reminders of their aspirations. Marsiling residents can also join in
a community art piece at Marsiling Countdown As One where they can add
colours to three large decorative banners. Meanwhile, Keat Hong Countdown
to 2026: All To Gather will feature a recycled fashion showcase where cancer
survivors modelling sustainable outfits made from recycled materials.</p>
