    Singaporeans can look forward to a series of celebrations at 12 heartland locations over the weekend of 6 and 7 August 2022, and on Tuesday, 9 August 2022 for National Day this year. This will allow more Singaporeans to participate in the festivities as we commemorate Singapore’s 57 years of independence.

    The National Day Parade (NDP) 2022 Heartland Celebrations seek to engage Singaporeans, their families and communities in the National Day festivities. Chairman of the NDP 2022 Heartlands Committee, Colonel Kwek Kian Leong said, “The NDP 2022 Heartland Committee has put together an exciting line-up of programmes for Singaporeans to come together as a community to celebrate another year of our nation’s independence. Singaporeans and their families can enjoy various activities and NDP favourites, such as the Red Lions, fireworks and static displays of vehicles from the SAF and the Home Team. We look forward to celebrating with all Singaporeans.”

    Of the 12 locations, five are Heartland Celebration Carnival sites situated across the island. The carnivals are organised in partnership with the People’s Association and will comprise exhibitions, performances and activities for families.

    People’s Association (PA) Group Director (Grassroots) Mr Pow Choon Ghee said, “PA and the NDP 2022 Executive Committee have curated exciting activities and programmes to engage Singaporeans island-wide at five heartland locations. Our PA volunteers have worked hard to bring the NDP festivities closer to the community, and we hope that residents will join us in these community celebrations with their families and friends.”

    To ensure the safety of the attendees, admission into the Heartland Celebration Carnival sites will be ticketed based on the respective site capacities. From 14 July 2022, 10 am onwards, the public will be able to collect entry tickets and carnival coupons at their nearest Community Clubs (CCs) on a first-come, first-served basis. These carnival coupons allow for the redemption of items such as NDP packs at the carnival sites. Additionally, from 23 July 2022, 10 am onwards, the public will also be able to apply for entry-only e-tickets to the carnival sites via the BookingSG link on the NDP website. These tickets will be released on a first-come, first-served basis. More details such as the list of CCs can be found on the NDP website (www.ndp.gov.sg) from 13 July 2022, 5pm onwards.

    NDP favourites will also be making their way into the heartlands. On 7 Aug, Singaporeans can look forward to viewing the Red Lions conduct freefall jumps at two heartland locations. On 9 Aug, there will be fireworks at five other heartland locations, as well as the Flag and Fighter Island Flypast.

    In line with national guidelines, the NDP 2022 Heartland Celebration sites will implement Vaccination Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS). All visitors must either be (i) a **fully vaccinated**_(1)_ individual; (ii) an individual certified to be medically ineligible for all vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme; or (iii) a child 12 years old and under, regardless of vaccination status. The public will be required to provide verification of their vaccination status_(2)_. Any visitors who are feeling unwell are advised to stay home and seek medical advice, when required.
