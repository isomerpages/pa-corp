<p><strong>PA statement on incident at Trivelis estate in Clementi</strong>
</p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; We regret that there are unverified reports in the media purporting to
suggest that the alleged suspect in the Clementi stabbing case was serving
in the grassroots. This is not true.

2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The alleged suspect is not a member of any PA grassroots organisation.

3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; We would have preferred to clarify this only after the Police have formally charged the suspect and released his identity. But to prevent the public
from being further misled by this inaccuracy, we have decided to clarify
the matter quickly.

4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; With the consent of the family of the deceased, we confirm that the deceased was a grassroots volunteer. The PA grassroots network and the Grassroots
Adviser are deeply saddened by his demise. More information about his service
to the community will be shared in remembrance during the funeral wake,
which will commence on 23 October. 

5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The family of the deceased have asked us to convey that they are deep
in grief and do not wish to entertain requests for media interviews. We
ask for this to please be respected.

6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; We further urge members of public not to forward or share graphic footage or images of the incident. This only intensifies the pain felt by the family
and the community.
