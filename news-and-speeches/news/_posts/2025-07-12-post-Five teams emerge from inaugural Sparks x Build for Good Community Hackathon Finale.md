co-organised by the People's Association (PA) and Open Government Products
(OGP) concluded on 12 July 2025 at Heartbeat@Bedok Atrium. This marks the
first partnership between PA and OGP for a Community Hackathon. Minister
for Digital Development and Information and Minister-in-charge of Smart
Nation and Cybersecurity, Mrs Josephine Teo; Senior Minister of State for
the Ministry of Trade and Industry and Ministry of Culture, Community and

<p>After one month of research, development, mentorship and user testing,
21 teams presented their working prototypes to address community challenges
to a distinguished panel of government leaders and industry experts at
the finale. From these, five teams were selected to advance to a 8-week
Build for Good (BFG) Accelerator programme, where they will refine their
solutions and launch them in the community. The five teams are <a href="https://www.community-hackathon.gov.sg/2025/callbridge" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">CallBridge</a>,

<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The partnership successfully combines OGP’s <a href="https://www.build.gov.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Build for Good</a> product development
programme that includes mentorship and workshops, with PA’s efforts as
part of its broader <a href="https://www.pa.gov.sg/our-programmes/pa-sparks/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Sparks</a> initiative
and its deep community connections. The collaboration aims to harness the
collective knowledge and experiences of the community to co-create innovative
tech solutions. By offering dedicated support and resources, the Community
Hackathon seeks to facilitate the development of community-led innovation,
transform the community aspirations into tangible solutions, and foster
greater ownership of ground-up initiatives that can benefit our communities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>A month of intensive research, development, and user testing culminated in the selection of five teams.</strong></h4>
<ol start="4" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Community Hackathon, which kicked off on 11 June 2025, brought together
over 90 youths. Forming teams of 3 to 5, they developed tech solutions
for diverse community challenges, including eldercare and caregiver support,
community gardening, youth development and social services support. Over
the course of the month, the teams delved deep into understanding these
challenges, ensuring their problem statements accurately reflected community
needs.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The participants engaged with PA's <a href="https://www.pa.gov.sg/our-programmes/pa-sparks/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Community Innovation Taskforces (CITs)</a>,
comprising active Grassroots Leaders and partners, who provided firsthand
insights into pressing local issues and invited residents to test and provide
input to the solutions. The teams also received mentorship from OGP officers
and tech professionals from <a href="http://Better.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Better.sg</a>, participated in product workshops
led by OGP officers, and gained support from alumni of past BFG runs. With
this support, the teams ideated, built prototypes, tested with users in
the community, gathered feedback, and refined their solutions for the finale,
where members of the public viewed the working prototypes. This approach
of co-creating and refining solutions together exemplifies the spirit of
community innovation that makes our community stronger.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the finale, five teams were selected by a panel of judges, comprising
government leaders and industry experts. They will advance to OGP’s 8-week
Build for Good (BFG) Accelerator programme, starting 24 July 2025. Each
selected team will receive $20,000 in funding and mentorship support to
further develop and launch their solutions. All other teams are encouraged
to collaborate with PA’s CITs who will provide funding support to implement
their solutions and continue making an impact in the community.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Diverse talents driving community solutions</strong></h4>
<ol start="7" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Community Hackathon participants come from diverse backgrounds, including
students, tech professionals and social service officers. The majority
(68%) were youths aged 18 to 24, demonstrating their enthusiasm in stepping
up to use technology to solve community challenges. Several teams dedicated
their efforts to creating solutions that better support vulnerable communities,
such as the elderly and their caregivers, lower-income families, individuals
with disabilities, and the homeless. One passionate team who cares for
the seniors even developed a solution to help the seniors understand official
documents in English, demonstrating their commitment to elderly care. What
truly made this Community Hackathon special was how participants, even
those without prior tech-building experience, harnessed their unique skills
and expertise. For instance, a social worker partnered with other participants
in developing solutions for mental health and peer support, demonstrating
the power of interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>

<p>“This idea came about during the research stage of the Hackathon, when
our volunteering experience made us more aware of the gaps and problems
faced by the deaf and hard of hearing community. From our interactions
and communications with them, we could better understand their pain points
and frustrations and were then able to develop a product that is beneficial
to them. With the Accelerator and funding, we look forward to the mentorship
provided by Open Government Products which will help us scale our product
to even greater heights.”</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>“We are excited to launch LetterKey in the community. Our visit to the
Senja Active Ageing Centre revealed that many seniors need help with daily
tasks like reading letters, an issue stemming not just from language barrier
but also from literacy and accessibility challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>LetterKey is an audio-first solution, designed specifically because seniors
often prefer listening to text. It enables them to understand their letters
in four languages - English, Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil aswell as two dialects,
Hokkien and Cantonese. In fact, one resident who tested LetterKey with
a Cantonese summary of an insurance document realised it wasn't as daunting
as she initially thought!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are looking forward to scaling LetterKey and integrating even more
dialects.”</p>

<p><strong>Red Flags - Jessica Olivia Pandjang (22)</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>“This Community Hackathon has created a good opportunity for youths like
us to make an impact in the community and to apply the skills we’ve picked
up in school and from being in the workforce to develop solutions for public
good. We hope that through Red Flags, we will be able to see every single
person experience a lower barrier to financial literacy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We're also working closely with Geylang West CIT, whose feedback from
user testing was very helpful in shaping the direction of Red Flags. Many
current and even future features that we’re planning to build, like personalisation
and comparison tools, came directly from the issues they highlighted to
us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the end of the day, every new version of Red Flags will be shaped by
what users need. We hope that even the layman will recognise that financial
literacy can be for everyone, and that they will be able to make informed
decisions on their own and not be placed in risky situations.”</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>“SeniorSays can help everyone across ages, because it creates a simpler
journey for everyone when it streamlines senior outreach by auto-filling
forms through conversation transcripts, which enables better, faster care—without
adding extra steps. Personally, I also see my mum not being able to adapt
to newer technologies, so I hope that SeniorSays can make it easier for
senior volunteers to help fill up the forms for fellow seniors.”</p>

<p><strong>SeniorSync - Lim Jitt Hing (23)</strong>

</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>“We’ve been working closely with Active Ageing Centres (AACs), Zhenghua
CIT, and Open Government Products to iterate our product and receive real
user feedback such that it is tailored to the pain points they experience.
SeniorSync is a result of the conversations we had with the AACs which
made us realise a gap in the availability of a centralised data system
to make caring for seniors more efficient.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We’re glad to be able to indirectly help the seniors by providing this
solution to AACs, and to also provide the caretakers with more opportunities
to spend quality time with seniors they care for. We’re looking forward
to being one step closer to the fruition of SeniorSync.”</p>

<p>“It’s a huge honour to be recognised for our product by the community,
which we hope can help the hawkers in Singapore. Hawker culture is something
that is in our lives every day as Singaporeans, yet little attention is
given to how the hawker culture may slowly fade away, just because senior
hawkers are not as savvy when it comes to doing publicity via social media.
So far, we have worked with 40 hawkers, and onboarded a total of 123 hawkers
across 3 hawker centres.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We believe that Hawkify can solve this problem in an effective manner,
and also bridge the gap between youths and hawkers as we lean into their
behaviour of wanting a visual experience to find out more about their favourite
hawker stores.”</p>
