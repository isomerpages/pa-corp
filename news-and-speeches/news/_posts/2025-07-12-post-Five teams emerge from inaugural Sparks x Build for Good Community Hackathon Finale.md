collective knowledge and experiences of the community to co-create innovative
tech solutions. By offering dedicated support and resources, the Community
Hackathon seeks to facilitate the development of community-led innovation,

<li>
<p>The Community Hackathon, which kicked off on 11 June 2025, brought together
over 90 youths. Forming teams of 3 to 5, they developed tech solutions
for diverse community challenges, including eldercare and caregiver support,
community gardening, youth development and social services support. Over
the course of the month, the teams delved deep into understanding these
challenges, ensuring their problem statements accurately reflected community
needs.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The participants engaged with PA's <a href="https://www.pa.gov.sg/our-programmes/pa-sparks/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Community Innovation Taskforces (CITs)</a>,
comprising active Grassroots Leaders and partners, who provided firsthand
insights into pressing local issues and invited residents to test and provide
input to the solutions. The teams also received mentorship from OGP officers
and tech professionals from <a href="http://Better.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Better.sg</a>, participated in product workshops
led by OGP officers, and gained support from alumni of past BFG runs. With
this support, the teams ideated, built prototypes, tested with users in
the community, gathered feedback, and refined their solutions for the finale,
where members of the public viewed the working prototypes. This approach
of co-creating and refining solutions together exemplifies the spirit of
community innovation that makes our community stronger.</p>
