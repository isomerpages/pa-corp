<p>The partnership successfully combines OGP’s <a href="https://www.build.gov.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Build for Good</a> product development
programme that includes mentorship and workshops, with PA’s efforts as
part of its broader <a href="https://www.pa.gov.sg/our-programmes/pa-sparks/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Sparks</a> initiative
and its deep community connections. The collaboration aims to harness the
collective knowledge and experiences of the community to co-create innovative
tech solutions. By offering dedicated support and resources, the Community
Hackathon seeks to facilitate the development of community-led innovation,
transform the community aspirations into tangible solutions, and foster
greater ownership of ground-up initiatives that can benefit our communities.</p>

<h4><strong>A month of intensive research, development, and user testing culminated in the selection of five teams.</strong></h4>
<ol start="4" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Community Hackathon, which kicked off on 11 June 2025, brought together
over 90 youths. Forming teams of 3 to 5, they developed tech solutions
for diverse community challenges, including eldercare and caregiver support,
community gardening, youth development and social services support. Over
the course of the month, the teams delved deep into understanding these
challenges, ensuring their problem statements accurately reflected community
needs.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The participants engaged with PA's <a href="https://www.pa.gov.sg/our-programmes/pa-sparks/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Community Innovation Taskforces (CITs)</a>,
comprising active Grassroots Leaders and partners, who provided firsthand
insights into pressing local issues and invited residents to test and provide
input to the solutions. The teams also received mentorship from OGP officers
and tech professionals from <a href="http://Better.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Better.sg</a>, participated in product workshops
led by OGP officers, and gained support from alumni of past BFG runs. With
this support, the teams ideated, built prototypes, tested with users in
the community, gathered feedback, and refined their solutions for the finale,
where members of the public viewed the working prototypes. This approach
of co-creating and refining solutions together exemplifies the spirit of
community innovation that makes our community stronger.</p>
<p></p>

<li>
<p>At the finale, five teams were selected by a panel of judges, comprising
government leaders and industry experts. They will advance to OGP’s 8-week
Build for Good (BFG) Accelerator programme, starting 24 July 2025. Each
selected team will receive $20,000 in funding and mentorship support to
further develop and launch their solutions. All other teams are encouraged
to collaborate with PA’s CITs who will provide funding support to implement
their solutions and continue making an impact in the community.</p>

</ol>
<h4><strong>Diverse talents driving community solutions</strong></h4>
<ol start="7" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Community Hackathon participants come from diverse backgrounds, including
students, tech professionals and social service officers. The majority
(68%) were youths aged 18 to 24, demonstrating their enthusiasm in stepping
up to use technology to solve community challenges. Several teams dedicated
their efforts to creating solutions that better support vulnerable communities,
such as the elderly and their caregivers, lower-income families, individuals
with disabilities, and the homeless. One passionate team who cares for
the seniors even developed a solution to help the seniors understand official
documents in English, demonstrating their commitment to elderly care. What
truly made this Community Hackathon special was how participants, even
those without prior tech-building experience, harnessed their unique skills
and expertise. For instance, a social worker partnered with other participants
in developing solutions for mental health and peer support, demonstrating
the power of interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>

<p>About “Sparks” initiative by PA</p>
<p>“Sparks” initiative brings together community stakeholders such as residents,
community and</p>
<p>corporate partners, and volunteers to identify community challenges and
collaboratively develop</p>
<p>solutions to meet community needs and aspirations. This initiative is
inspired by PA's mission to</p>
<p>empower communities and foster a stronger sense of ownership and belonging
and builds on the</p>
<p>broader vision of reimagining Community Clubs/Centres (CC) as spaces where
innovation thrives</p>
<p>and community aspirations come to life.</p>
<p>To drive this vision forward, ten CCs have been selected to pilot the
Sparks at CC. Each CC will</p>
<p>set up Community Innovation Spaces (CISs) to serve as a platform where
multiple stakeholders</p>
<p>can spark creativity, converge, collaborate and formulate innovative solutions
to address local</p>
<p>issues. Complementing these spaces, Community Innovation Taskforces (CITs)
were formed</p>
<p>under the respective CCMC to provide localised insights on community needs
and aspirations,</p>
<p>drive ideation sessions, and curate engaging community activities within
the spaces.</p>
