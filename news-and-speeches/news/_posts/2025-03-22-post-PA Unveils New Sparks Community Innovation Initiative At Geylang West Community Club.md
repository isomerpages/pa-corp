<h3>People’s Association Unveils New Sparks Community Innovation Initiative At Geylang West Community Club</h3>
<p><em>Community Hackathon registration opens, to bring community stakeholders and tech experts to co-create innovative solutions for community challenges</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
People’s Association (PA) will launch the “Sparks” initiative that intends
to build a stronger sense of community participation by fostering collaboration
and empowering diverse stakeholders to actively shape their neighbourhoods.
&nbsp;Mr Edwin Tong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second
Minister for Law and Deputy Chairman of PA, together with Minister Josephine
Teo, Grassroots Adviser to Jalan Besar GRC, will unveil the first PA Community
Innovation Space - Sparks @ Geylang West on Saturday, 22 March 2025 at
Geylang West CC.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Sparks" initiative is a community innovation movement - by the community,
for the community. &nbsp;It<strong> </strong>brings together diverse community
stakeholders including residents, partners and volunteers to identify local
challenges, transforming community aspirations into tangible solutions
that meet local needs. &nbsp;Following Prime Minister Lawrence Wong’s vision
at the PA Community Club Management Committee (CCMC) 60<sup>th</sup> Anniversary
last year, this initiative reimagines CCs as catalyst spaces for community-led
innovation and collaboration, uniting the community and fostering greater
ownership of ground-up initiatives.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To drive this vision forward and as part of the broader “Sparks” initiative, <strong>ten CCs </strong>have
been selected to pilot “Sparks” at CC (refer to Annex A).&nbsp; Each CC
will set up a <strong>Community Innovation Space (CIS),</strong> creating
a dedicated collaborative space where residents, volunteers, and partners
can come together, share ideas, and curate meaningful initiatives that
resonate with their community's unique needs and aspiration. &nbsp;These
spaces will be the heart of innovation, fostering partnerships and empowering
stakeholders to drive positive change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As PA’s first
pilot site for Sparks at CC, Geylang West CC has embarked on their community
innovation journey since last October. &nbsp;While serving a significant
senior population, the recent new Build-To-Order (BTO) developments have
inspired Geylang West to engage PMETs and young families in designing and
participating in environmental sustainability programmes that allows them
to contribute to the community’s unique needs, fostering a spirit of community
care.&nbsp; Through two engaging ideation sessions, they brought in like-minded
partners like Micron Semiconductor Asia Operations Pte Ltd, Commenhers,
Corridor Farmers, and LED Signs Pte Ltd. &nbsp;Together with residents
and volunteers, several eco-friendly initiatives have taken root, including
a Wheelchair Repair initiative which is particularly impactful in a senior-centric
community where many seniors require mobility assistance.</p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To drive activities
at the CIS,<strong> Community Innovation Taskforces (CITs)</strong> have
been established under the respective CCMCs. &nbsp;These taskforces will
provide localised insights into community needs. &nbsp;They will facilitate
brainstorming sessions at the CIS, supporting and guiding community stakeholders
in transforming their ideas into tangible solutions that will benefit the
community.&nbsp; To empower these ground-up efforts, the PA will provide
funding of up to $20,000 for each initiative, supporting up to 50 initiatives
over the next three years.</p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To catalyse its
community innovation efforts, PA and Open Government Products (OGP) will
co-organise a <strong>Sparks x BFG Community Hackathon.&nbsp; </strong>The
event is<strong> </strong>one of the<strong> </strong>key platforms under
the “Sparks” initiative, alongside Community Innovation Spaces and Community
Innovation Taskforces, working together to foster a new era of community-driven
solutions.&nbsp; <strong>Interested participants are invited to register for the Community Hackathon</strong> at
<a href="https://go.gov.sg/pa-ch2025" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>go.gov.sg/pa-ch2025</u>
</a><strong> </strong>where they can contribute their unique perspectives
and diverse skills to develop tech-driven solutions for the community.&nbsp; <strong>Registration commences on 22 March 2025 and will close on 6 April 2025.</strong>&nbsp;

<p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Sparks @ Geylang West</strong> will
be officially opened on 22 March 2025, marking an important milestone of
PA in the community innovation journey.&nbsp; An Eco Day will be organised
in conjunction with the opening, featuring engagement booths from community
and corporate partners, each designed to educate and inspire residents
about environmentally friendly practices.</p>
