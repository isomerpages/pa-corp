<p>NATIONAL COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE LOOKS AHEAD TO EMPOWER FUTURE
COMMUNITY LEADERS AS IT CELEBRATES 60 YEARS OF COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY
LEADERSHIP</p>
<p>The National Community Leadership Institute (NACLI) is celebrating its
60th anniversary this year, commemorating six decades of unwavering commitment
to community development. Established in 1964 by the People’s Association
(PA), NACLI has been instrumental in nurturing and empowering community
leaders, equipping them with the skills to engage the community and foster
social cohesion. As NACLI marks its 60th anniversary, it will leverage
PA’s rich community building experience and expand its efforts in capability
development of future community leaders, including youths and leaders from
civic societies, to support the community.</p>
<p>2 In conjunction with NACLI’s 60th Anniversary, NACLI will be launching
two new leadership programmes, reaching other sectors of community, and
empowering community leaders to drive positive impact in Singapore's diverse
communities. In addition, a new community gallery is planned to open in
August 2025, highlighting the nation’s journey in community building.</p>
<p>Youth Leaders Collective</p>
<p>3 NACLI will be launching an inaugural youth leadership programme, titled
the Youth Leaders Collective, to inspire and empower youth leaders to take
individual and collective action towards building a shared future. NACLI's
origins can be traced back to the establishment of the Buona Vista Youth
Leadership Training Centre in 1964, underscoring the institute’s enduring
dedication to youth training. This programme reaffirms PA’s and NACLI’s
commitment to investing in the development of the future generation of
leaders, empowering them to contribute to Singapore's advancement by fostering
a deeper understanding of the Singapore narrative.</p>

<p>4 The 10-week programme aims to involve 50 youth leaders, aged 17 to 19,
using their passion to champion causes they care about and strengthen their
volunteer footprint in the community. Additionally, it will provide the
youth leaders with an exclusive opportunity for an overseas Immersion Programme
to expand their global perspectives and enhance their cross-cultural awareness.</p>
<p>Leadership in Community Programme</p>
<p>5 The Leadership in Community Programme, which will be launched in November
2024, aims to uplift the capabilities of grassroots and civic society leadership
by equipping them with a comprehensive understanding of Singapore's social
compact, PA's role in national unity, as well as essential skills and networks
for effective community building.</p>
<p>6 Throughout the six-month long programme, participants will get to engage
with distinguished guest speakers and thought leaders to gain broader perspectives
on developments in the macro environment, international geopolitics, and
understand their impact on the local community. They will also have the
opportunity to experience a vibrant multicultural society through an overseas
study trip, observing and participating firsthand in the local community
engagement efforts at both the governmental and ground-up levels.</p>
<p>Community Gallery</p>
<p>7 The new community gallery showcases the nation’s journey in community
building. It aims to inspire and educate the future generation of leaders,
instilling in them a deep appreciation for the power of community engagement
and the possibilities of future in community building, encouraging individuals
to make a difference in their own capacity, and contributing to a renewed
social compact.</p>
<p>8 The initiatives will be announced by Mr Edwin Tong, Minister for Culture,
Community and Youth, Second Minister for Law, and Deputy Chairman of People’s
Association at NACLI’s 60th anniversary conference and learning festival
on Saturday, 28 September 2024, at the NACLI campus. This milestone event
will feature keynote addresses, panel discussions and a series of engaging
workshops to inspire and equip community leaders and stakeholders with
the knowledge and skills necessary to drive positive change in their respective
communities.</p>
