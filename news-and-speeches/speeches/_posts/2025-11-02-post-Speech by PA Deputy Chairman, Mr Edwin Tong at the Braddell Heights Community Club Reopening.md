<p><strong>Speech by PA Deputy Chairman, Mr Edwin Tong at the Braddell Heights Community Club Official Reopening</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Welcome Greetings</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Grassroots Adviser Speaker Seah Kian Peng,</p>
<p>Distinguished guests,</p>
<p>and our dear residents of Braddell Heights</p>
<p></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good
morning and a very warm welcome to the grand opening of the upgraded Braddell
Heights Community Club.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Braddell
Heights has been a stronghold of community bonding since 1976 – nearly
five decades of shared memories, friendships, and purpose.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
did not happen by chance. It is the result of the tireless dedication from
our grassroots volunteers who have worked passionately to bring people
together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks
to many dedicated individuals:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Lee Tee Loon, BBM (Chairman, Braddell Heights
CCC)</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Raymond Chan, PBM (Chairman, Braddell Heights
CCMC)</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Loo Chin Nong, BBM (Honorary Chairman, Braddell
Heights CCMC)</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Chris Chu, PBM (Organising Chairman, BHCC Official
Reopening)</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, my old friend, GRA and Speaker of Parliament
Mr Seah Kian Peng.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together
with the grassroots team and PA staff, their leadership has been instrumental
in making this vision a reality.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Community Clubs: Pillars of Singapore's Social Fabric</u></strong>
</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CCs
have been central to Singapore's social landscape for over 70 years.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were
first established in the 1950s to foster social cohesion and nation-building.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
early days, at home, there was no TV, no newspaper and no ping pong table.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So you had to come to the CC for TV, read the papers and have some sporting
and social interaction.</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today,
it’s very different.</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everybody
has a TV – most people. Many have mobile phones and they don’t use TV anymore.
People spend more time online.</p>
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, the fundamental paradigm has changed very much.</p>
<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PA has
to continually adapt and innovate to respond to an evolving society and
new challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Community Clubs Today: Evolving to Meet Changing Needs</u></strong>
</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And
we have done so.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our CCs
continue to play a crucial role in achieving PA’s mission of connecting
Government to people; people to people and bring residents together, regardless
of race, language or religion.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our CCs
continue to be the centre of gravity for major community events and activities.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We offer
a wide range of programmes catering to diverse interests and age groups.</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To cater
to the growing and diverse needs of residents, PA has also expanded our
range of community facilities with different models of CCs that take into
account local needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today,
we have a network of 110 community clubs, 4 integrated community hubs,
7 PAssion Wave outlets and 754 Residents’ Committee / Residents’ Network
Centres.</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By 2026,
all our RN centres will be retrofitted with smart devices – e.g. Smart
door access for residents to enter conveniently to use the community spaces
to study, work and play.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another
is digital display panels installed outside all smart RN centres - residents
will be able to see the latest, up to date community news and activities
in the neighbourhood!&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the
latest CC model is the CC in a mall e.g. Bidadari and Buangkok CC, where
the CC is integrated within a shopping mall, bringing community spaces
closer to where people live, work and play.</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have
some new CCs, Mountbatten CC and Tengah CC.</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have
to think of our facilities well, and that’s why we continue to upgrade
our CCs, continue to redevelop, refresh our CCs for our residents.</p>
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Upgraded many existing CCs like Tampines North CC and the CC we are at
now – Braddell Heights CC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Managing Facilities to Drive Social Cohesion</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
must also think of different and innovative ways to engage residents.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our facilities need to evolve
in tandem with how lifestyles of residents have changed over the years.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When popular interests
such as water sports, sustainability programmes `and more recently, drone
flying are identified as part of a growing and enduring trend, we marshalled
our resources rapidly into redeveloping our infrastructure.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Vibrant community
spaces that address the new needs of our residents are created. I am heartened
to share that these refreshed spaces have witnessed higher footfall, and
heightened community bonding.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Putting Users First, Reconfiguring Spaces for More Flexibility</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, we launched “Sparks”
where a CC have a dedicated collaborative space for residents, volunteers
and partners to curate projects that address community’s needs.</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have 10 CCMCs
to step forward to think about this as a pilot to looks at flexible spaces,
fit for user needs and not the other way round.</p>
<p></p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes we think of our
CCs as a space – a dance studio, can only do dance. And a cooking studio
is only for cooking classes.</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what if
we thought about it the other way round?</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who are the
users and users’ needs should come first, then we think how we can reconfigure
the spaces.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, this initiative – “Sparks”
is to think about the flexibility and innovation behind spaces.</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This initiative
has sparked community participation in thinking out of the box of how we
use our common spaces.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Transforming Braddell Heights CC</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Braddell Heights CC,
we have expanded the space to over 6,000 square metres.</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bigger multi-purpose
hall, a sheltered outdoor fitness area, as well as dedicated rooms for
music, dance, karaoke and the arts. Something for everyone.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other major attraction
of the CCs, is the heartware.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Braddell Heights, the
youths are organising their own micro-communities.</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They’ve formed
a cheerleading team known as Braddell Heights Team Xtreme Cheerleading.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they’re
not just involved in cheerleading. Members like Austin Yue are familiar
sights, helping out at Braddell Heights events.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cheerleading
group also helped to clean and declutter seniors’ homes in Braddell Heights.</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hope more
youths like Austin can step forward and be involved in bettering the lives
of Braddell Heights residents!</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CC will
continue to offer other youth related activities, hoping to attract even
more youths to the CC.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upgraded Braddell Heights
CC is more than a new building.</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s the start of
a new chapter. For the micro-communities that have long thrived here, and
the many more who will start using the CC as a hub.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These micro-communities
will strengthen bonds in the community, and help us to build a “We First”
society, where each of us must continue to do our part to care, to contribute
and to look out for one another to strengthen our Singapore spirit, and
we have to do more to encourage Singaporeans to step forward. &nbsp;</p>
<p>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, kudos to the
local grassroots leaders and community for building a strong and inclusive
community here. Let this opening be the start of even more beautiful memories
together!</p>
