<p><strong>BRADDELL HEIGHTS COMMUNITY CLUB OFFICIAL REOPENING</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>2 NOVEMBER 2025 AT</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>BRADDELL HEIGHTS COMMUNITY CLUB</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Welcome Greetings</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Grassroots Adviser Speaker Seah Kian Peng,</p>
<p>Distinguished guests,</p>
<p>and our dear residents of Braddell Heights</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good
morning and a very warm welcome to the grand opening of the upgraded Braddell
Heights Community Club.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Braddell
Heights has been a stronghold of community bonding since 1976 – nearly
five decades of shared memories, friendships, social cohesion and purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;Today, after 3 years of upgrading, we are now re-opened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
big thank you to all grassroots leaders, volunteers, sponsors and partners
who have made this possible</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks
to many dedicated individuals:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Lee Tee Loon, BBM (Chairman, Braddell Heights
CCC)</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Raymond Chan, PBM (Chairman, Braddell Heights
CCMC)</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Loo Chin Nong, BBM (Honorary Chairman, Braddell
Heights CCMC)</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Chris Chu, PBM (Organising Chairman, BHCC Official
Reopening)</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And GRA and Speaker of Parliament Mr Seah Kian Peng.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together
with the grassroots team and PA staff, your leadership has been instrumental
in making this vision a reality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And
we look forward to Braddell Heights CC, doing more to serve its residents
again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With events and many
programmes, but more importantly as a space for us to meet, work and simply
to do things together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Making friends, helping
one another, this is how we build that special Singaporean community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Community Clubs: Pillars of Singapore's Social Fabric</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed,
our CC spaces have been central to the building of Singapore's social landscape
for over 70 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CC spaces were first established
in the 1950s to foster social cohesion and nation-building. This is even
before PA was formally set up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
early days, at home, there was no TV, no newspaper and no ping pong table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, you had to come to the CC for TV, read the papers and have some sporting
and social interaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today,
it’s very different. We don’t see the CC in the same way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people
don’t come to the CCs for TV – maybe except when there is World Cup!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, the fundamental paradigm has changed very much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is
therefore important for PA to continually adapt and innovate, refresh our
space, evolve our space to the needs of the new population and society,
and also to meet new challenges.</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Community Clubs Today: Evolving to Meet Changing Needs</u></strong>
</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And
we will continue to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our CCs
must always remain a space for all of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of
us must see relevance in this space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A place
to connect Government to people; people to people, bringing residents together,
building social cohesion, sharing a “We-First” community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our CCs
must continue to be the centre of gravity for major community events and
activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And
to cater to a growing and diverse needs of our residents,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PA has also expanded
our range of community facilities, and we now adopt different models of
CCs that take into account the local needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have standalone
CCs, integrated CCs and we have those that are co-located with commercial
properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, we have a network
of</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 110 community clubs,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 integrated
community hubs; One Punggol, Our Tampines Hub, Wisma Geylang Serai and
Heartbeat@Bedok),</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7 PAssion Wave
outlets and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 754 Residents’
Network Centres (RN Centres).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, we also
have RN Centres all over in the different precincts and these RN centres
serve our micro-communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We continually upgrade them.</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At any
given point in time, we have about 40 of these facilities either being
upgraded, developed or going through cyclical maintenance.</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we
have different models – the latest CC model is CC co-located with a mall.</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like what
we see at Bidadari CC and Buangkok CC.</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where
the CC is integrated within a shopping mall, this allows us to bring the
community spaces closer to where people work, live and play.</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also
have a few new CCs coming up – Mountbatten CC and Tengah CC. The latter,
opened a few months ago – to cater to a growing population in a new town.</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, CCs must
also be well maintained – and that’s why we continue to upgrade our CCs,
continue to redevelop, refresh our CCs for our residents.</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have
upgraded many existing CCs like Tampines North CC and the CC we are at
now – Braddell Heights CC.</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition,
we have to take advantage of technology.</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By end
2026, all 754 RN centres will be retrofitted with smart devices – e.g.
Smart door access for residents to enter conveniently to use the community
spaces to study, work or to organise local events for the local community.</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will
also have digital display panels installed outside all smart RN centres
- residents will be able to see the latest, up to date community news and
activities in the neighbourhood!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Managing Facilities to Drive Social Cohesion</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must also grow our offerings
at the CC, to meet residents’ interests, in the sports they want to take
part in, the activities we have now are newer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When popular interests
such as water sports, sustainability programmes and more recently, drone
flying are identified as part of a growing trend, we introduced them at
our CCs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Putting Users First, Reconfiguring Spaces for More Flexibility</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, we launched “Sparks”
- to allow CCs to have free spaces, dedicated to collaborative projects
for residents, volunteers and partners to brainstorm and propose ideas
that can address the local community needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have 10 CCMCs
to step forward to think about this as a pilot to look at flexible spaces,
fit for user needs and not the other way round.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes we think of our
CCs as a space – a dance studio, a cooking studio, there might be a badminton
hall but these are only spaces that we designed them to be so, if we do
not have much of imagination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what if
we thought about it the other way round?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start with the
users and users’ needs, which should come first, then we think how we can
reconfigure the spaces to meet those needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, this initiative – “Sparks”
is to think about the flexibility and innovation behind spaces. Allow us
to work with the community, volunteers and community partners to think
of ideas to benefit our community even more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Transforming Braddell Heights CC</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Braddell Heights CC,
we have expanded the space to over 6,000 square metres.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bigger multi-purpose
hall, a sheltered outdoor fitness area, as well as dedicated rooms for
music, dance, karaoke and the arts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something for
everyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But beyond physical spaces,
the CC is also a place to build networks and heartware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Braddell Heights, the
youths are organising their own micro-communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They’ve formed
a cheerleading team known as Braddell Heights Team Xtreme Cheerleading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But they’re
not just involved in cheerleading - they use this also as a platform to
gather and to spillover into broader community work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members like
Austin Yue are familiar sights, helping out regularly at Braddell Heights
events.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cheerleading
group also helped to clean and declutter seniors’ homes in Braddell Heights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hope more
youths like Austin can step forward, take part in events at the CC but
use the platform to build stronger networks and plug into the rest of the
community and serve the rest of the community. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upgraded Braddell Heights
CC is more than a new building.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a gathering
point, a place for bonding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A place for building
relationships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s a place
for bridging the young and old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And across different
divides, races, religion and background.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is our common
space. This is a space for all of you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I
hope that you will use this space not just as place for hosting facilities
but a space for building, enhancing and improving our social connections
and social cohesion in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PM had mentioned – to build
a “We First” society, where each of us must continue to do our part to
care, to contribute and to look out for one another to strengthen our Singapore
spirit, and we have to do more to encourage Singaporeans to step forward.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, congratulations
to the local grassroots leaders and community for building a strong and
inclusive community here. Let this opening be the start of even more beautiful
memories together!</p>
