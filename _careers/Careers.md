#### We Develop Your Potential

Our belief in creating a better community is matched by our belief in our people. Throughout your career with us, expect to have opportunities for development to bring out the best in you, to upgrade your skills, and to improve your work performance. Starting with an Induction Programme for new officers to better understand PA and our mission, you can look forward to a wide range of courses offered at our very own training facilities at the National Community Leadership Institute (NACLI). We also engage other training providers to offer specialised programmes.

#### We Offer You Experiences in Diverse Areas of Work

Working with us, you will have many opportunities to build your career in different areas within the PA network. You could be posted to units such as the Constituency Offices, Community Development Councils, or Water-Venture – our very own adventure and water-sports outlets. With these experiences, you will enjoy the process of discovering yourself and uncover your true potential.

#### We Offer Competitive Remuneration, Benefits and A Healthy Working Environment

PA is committed to attracting, motivating and retaining talented individuals. We have a competitive salary structure that includes annual wage supplements, salary increments, performance bonuses, and PA allowances, if applicable. We advocate work-life harmony, and aim to provide a healthy working environment. Our officers enjoy birthday off and wellness leave for wedding, parenthood, child’s first day of school, child’s graduation and eldercare. For our efforts in promoting work-life and workplace health, we received the Singapore H.E.A.L.T.H (Helping Employees Achieve Life-Time Health) Award - Platinum Award presented by the Health Promotion Board.
