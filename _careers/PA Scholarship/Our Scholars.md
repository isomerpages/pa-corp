&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In an increasingly polarised world, I want to contribute to the larger 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;movement of “Forward Singapore”, by bridging existing gaps 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between individuals to create a more cohesive and united country. I 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope to build communities where people's relationships with their 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbours extend beyond mere geographical acquaintances, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evolving into an extended social support network for one another.”

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In these trying times, I believe that it is crucial for citizens to work 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand in hand with the government, based on shared interests to 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;progress and prosper. As such, I hope to strengthen both 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people-to-people and people-to-government bonds by promoting 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;greater harmony and increasing collaboration."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I learnt that there is greater depth to PA’s work, in empowering
