#### Sustainability Reports
The public sector announced its commitment to achieve net zero emissions around 2045 under the GreenGov.SG initiative. &nbsp;As we embark on our mission to spark and nurture community participation for a caring and united Singapore, we will do so sustainably with our staff, Grassroots volunteers, community partners and residents. PA will be publishing our Sustainability Report starting from FY2023. The report aims to promote transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement in sustainability efforts across PA.

##### Citizens’ Consultative Committee: 50 years of Strong Bonds, Active Community 1965 – 2015
<img style="width:600px" align="center" src="/images/NewsRoom/Publications/Cover2.jpg">

Citizens’ Consultative Committee: 50 years of Strong Bonds, Active Community 1965 – 2015” chronicles the Citizens’ Consultative Committee (CCC)’s development over the last 50 years and how they are the backbone, stitching together the social fabric of Singapore. The CCCs have achieved much during the last 50 years but more commendable is the way the CCCs continue to stay in touch with Singaporeans’ aspirations during decades of rapid nation building. This book showcases their good work and pays tribute to the grassroots leaders and volunteers as we celebrate 50 years of nationhood.
