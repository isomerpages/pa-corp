<h1>What is Ramadan?</h1>
<p>Ramadan is a holy month of fasting, prayer, and reflection for Muslims
worldwide. They abstain from food, drink, and other indulgences during
daylight hours, focusing on spiritual growth and acts of charity. This
period of self-discipline and empathy concludes with the celebration of
Hari Raya Puasa.</p>

<h2>5 things you might not know about Ramadan and Hari Raya Puasa</h2>
<h3>It's not the Muslim new year</h3>
<p>Hari Raya Puasa marks the end of a month of fasting during Ramadan and
is not a celebration of a new year!</p>
<h3>Not all Muslims are required to fast during Ramadan</h3>
<p>While fasting during Ramadan is obligatory for most healthy adult Muslims,
exemptions exist for certain groups:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The elderly, sick, and travellers are excused from fasting, though travellers
are expected to make up the missed days later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pregnant, menstruating, and breastfeeding women are also exempt from fasting
due to their specific conditions.</p>
</li>

<h3>What is the difference between Hari Raya Puasa and Hari Raya Haji?</h3>
<p>Though both celebrated with joy, Hari Raya Puasa and Hari Raya Haji mark
different occasions.</p>
<p>Hari Raya Puasa celebrates the end of the fasting month of Ramadan while
Hari Raya Haji commemorates the completion of the Hajj pilgrimage and honours
Prophet Ibrahim's sacrifice, often referred to as the "day of sacrifice."</p>
<p>During this festival, Muslims traditionally slaughter livestock and share
it with the less fortunate.</p>
<h3>Sealed envelopes with money are handed out during Hari Raya Puasa</h3>
<p>Known as duit raya or "Raya money", these are traditionally handed out
in envelopes to children and elders during Hari Raya Puasa.</p>
