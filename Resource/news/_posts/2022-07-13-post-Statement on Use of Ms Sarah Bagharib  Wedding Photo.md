#### Statement on Use of Ms Sarah Bagharib's Wedding Photo for Hari Raya Decorations at Tiong Bahru Orchid Estate.

**Summary**: 

We would like to provide an update on the matter of the inappropriate use of Ms Sarah Bagharib's wedding photo for Hari Raya decorations at Tiong Bahru Orchid estate. 

**Description**: 

We would like to provide an update on the matter of the inappropriate use of Ms Sarah Bagharib's wedding photo for Hari Raya decorations at Tiong Bahru Orchid estate. 

 

Radin Mas Constituency Office (CO) had engaged a vendor, Warabi Enterprise (Art Studio), to design and put up Hari Raya decorations at the Tiong Bahru Orchid estate.  

 

The vendor came up with the concept and design for the decorations. Unfortunately, in doing so, they downloaded and used Ms Sarah Bagharibâ€™s photo from an online source and then used it for a cut-out standee. These decorations, including the standee, was then put up by Radin Mas CO. 

 

This should not have happened. Neither our vendor nor Radin Mas CO obtained any permission to do so. This is against the policies which have been put in place. We have since spoken to the vendor on the seriousness of this infringement, and will follow up with the appropriate steps. 

 

Nonetheless the PA, including Radin Mas CO, take responsibility for this error as we have oversight of the matter, the decorations were allowed to be put up.  

 

As soon as we were made aware of the issue, we had immediately removed the standee. 

 

We take such breaches, including copyright violations, seriously.  We will put in place stricter internal controls and processes to ensure this does not happen again. 

 

In addition, we regret the use of the photo to depict the Hari Raya occasion. This was not appropriate.  

 

We will take steps to guide and help our staff and, as far as possible, external vendors as well, to be more culturally-attuned and sensitive. 

 

We have apologised unreservedly to Ms Sarah Bagharib and her family for the distress our mistake has caused. We have given her an explanation of the circumstances which led to the error and have also offered to meet with her to discuss any other concerns which she might have.
