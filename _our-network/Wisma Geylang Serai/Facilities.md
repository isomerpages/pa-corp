#### Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery
For most Singaporeans, Geylang Serai is a historical precinct known for its bustling market and festive bazaars during the month of Ramadhan. However, there is much more to the precinct than simply being an emporium of goods and a hub for traditional trades such as tailors and hawkers.

The Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery showcases the history of the precinct and traces its growth from an outlying settler community in the 19th  century to the suburban business precinct it is today. It also features the memories and experiences of its past and present residents, and interweave these stories with thematic displays of images and objects.

The Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery is a community gallery that is developed and managed by National Heritage Board in partnership with People’s Association and Malay Heritage Foundation.
