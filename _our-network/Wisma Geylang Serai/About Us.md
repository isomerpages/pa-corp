#### ABOUT WISMA GEYLANG SERAI

Wisma Geylang Serai (WGS), which is part of the Peopleâ€™s Association, has been envisioned as the community, social, civic, and cultural heart of the Geylang Serai precinct. The WGS hub is a culturally distinctive and inclusive multi-agency development that aims to celebrate the heritage of Geylang Serai and all other local communities to encourage social interaction and community bonding across all ages and races. It houses the Geylang Serai Community Club, South East Community Development Council, Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery, KURNIA@WGS, arts houses as well as other social and community-related facilities.

WGS holds the annual Hari Raya Light Up (along Geylang Road and Sims Avenue) and the biggest Ramadan Bazaar which receives thousands of people. Throughout the year, WGS collaborate with partners and stakeholder to hold smaller bazaars and community programmes ranging from arts and culture, health and lifestyle, youth and entertainment for the community and residents.
