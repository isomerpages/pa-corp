<h4>NACLI celebrates its 60th Anniversary</h4>
<p>NACLI commemorates our six decades of community leadership, marking a
significant milestone in our journey.</p>
<p>NACLI's journey over the pat 60 years has been marked by significant milestones,
reflecting its evolution and enduring commitment to community leadership.
From its establishment as the Buona Vista Youth Leadership Training Centre
in 1964 to its transformation into the National Community Leadership Institute
(NACLI) in 1995, the institute has continually adapted to the changing
environment. As NACLI continues to refresh its training courses and offer
programmes in various modalities, it remains dedicated to shaping the future
of community leadership.</p>
<p>Join us as we remember our past, celebrate our present, and chart our
future, celebrating 60 years of community leadership!</p>
