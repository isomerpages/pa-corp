<h4>NACLI celebrates its 60th Anniversary</h4>
<p>NACLI commemorates six decades of community leadership development, marking
a significant milestone in our journey of developing, aligning and inspiring
leaders in service of the community.</p>
<p>From its establishment as the Buona Vista Youth Leadership Training Centre
in 1964, till its present positioning as the National Community Leadership
Institute since 1995, the Institute had undergone several name changes;
reflecting its agility in responding to and anticipating the needs of the
evolving societal landscape in the past six decades.&nbsp; Today, through
its relevant, timely and targeted training, NACLI remains committed to
being at the forefront of community leadership development in support of
shaping the future of community building.</p>
<p>NACLI’s 60th anniversary celebration will be commemorated by a conference
with the theme "Redefining Community Leadership for the Future."</p>
