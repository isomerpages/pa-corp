<p>In this workshop, participants will encounter an AI-enabled coach that
guides them on how to promote stakeholders' dignity in a community setting.
Through a familiar video-chat format, participants will gain useful feedback
on whether their facial expressions, voice tone, body language, and words
make a stakeholder feel dignified or belittled. Participants should be
prepared to practise dynamically as they journey through a story arc, developing
an understanding of the conditions that lead to dignity violations and
how they might promote others’ dignity.</p>
