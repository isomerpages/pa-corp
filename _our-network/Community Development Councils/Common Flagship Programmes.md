Jointly developed by the National Integration Council (NIC) and the Community Development Councils (CDCs), the Corporate Social Integration (CSI) Fund encourages companies to do their part for the community by getting their employees to contribute in the most meaningful way.   For example, Corporate organisations may organise befriending session with vulnerable seniors, bring the underprivileged children out for fun-filled experience, or even bring festive cheers to our marginalised families, and at the same time, enable employees to build bonds and teamwork and use their skills and expertise for a greater good.

#### Law Awareness Weeks @ CDC (Law @ CDC)

On 28 September 2020, Minister Edwin Tong announced the renewal of two Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) – one MOU between the Community Development Councils (CDCs) and Law Society Pro Bono Services (LSPBS) on Community Legal Pro Bono Services Network (Community Legal Clinics); and one MOU between CDCs, LSPBS, three Institutes of Higher Learning (National University of Singapore, Singapore Management University and Singapore University of Social Sciences) and one new partner Singapore Counsel Association (SCCA) on Law Awareness Weeks @ CDC. 

LAW@CDC was started to educate residents through legal talks conducted across the five districts on basic legal knowledge. These talks are held at Community Centres/Clubs (CCs) and Residents' Committee (RC) Centres. The talks are tailored for those who are not legally trained by breaking down legal jargons so that they are easy 
to understand.

SFA is a community outreach initiative that was launched in 2017.  It helps residents to navigate through the SkillsFuture landscape and help them better understand their own strengths, and help them to be more aware of the types of skills needed in today’s employment, as well as the skypes of skills required for future of work.

The fund aims to support Social Service Agencies (SSAs) by engaging their beneficiaries through the arts.  The CDCs and the NAC renewed their partnership on 4 September 2017 by setting aside $1 million for the WeCare Arts Fund over the next two year for programmes that make arts inclusive and promote self-confidence among the led advantages and underserved communities. The fund supports project costs that involve artists working directly with SSAs and their beneficiaries through the Performing, Visual, Literary and Multi-Disciplinary arts.
