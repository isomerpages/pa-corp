<img style="width:600px" align="center" alt="Law Awareness Weeks @ CDC" src="/images/Our%20Network/Community%20Development%20Councils/LAWCDC.png">

LAW@CDC was started to educate residents through legal talks conducted across the five districts on basic legal knowledge. These talks are held at Community Centres/Clubs (CCs) and Residents' Committee (RC) Centres. The talks are tailored for those who are not legally trained by breaking down legal jargons so that they are easy to understand.

Jointly developed by the National Integration Council (NIC) and the Community Development Councils (CDCs), the Corporate Social Integration (CSI) Fund encourages companies to do their part for the community by getting their employees to contribute in the most meaningful way.
