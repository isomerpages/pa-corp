#### Common Flagship Programmes

The five Community Development Councils (CDCs) come together to run common flagship programmes to support the Government’s efforts in promoting a caring, inclusive, resilient and future-ready Singapore; and engender and spread goodwill among the people.

Below are examples of such collaboration.

Finance Minister Mr Lawrence Wong announced at Budget 2022 that the Community Development Councils (CDCs) will be giving three new tranches of the CDC Vouchers Scheme from 2022 to 2024 to support Singaporeans during difficult times. This is in addition to the $100 in CDC vouchers that every Singaporean household is eligible for, announced in Budget 2021.


In May 2022, the CDCs will distribute $100 worth of CDC Vouchers 2022 to each Singaporean Household to help in daily expenses as part of the Household Support Package. Singaporean households can use the vouchers to purchase goods and services from participating hawkers and heartland merchants.

Jointly developed by the National Integration Council (NIC) and the Community Development Councils (CDCs), the Corporate Social Integration (CSI) Fund encourages companies to do their part for the community by getting their employees to contribute in the most meaningful way.   For example, Corporate organisations may organise befriending session with vulnerable seniors, bring the underprivileged children out for fun-filled experience, or even bring festive cheers to our marginalised families, and at the same time, enable employees to build bonds and teamwork and use their skills and expertise for a greater good.

On 28 September 2020, Minister Edwin Tong announced the renewal of two Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) – one MOU between the Community Development Councils (CDCs) and Law Society Pro Bono Services (LSPBS) on Community Legal Pro Bono Services Network (Community Legal Clinics); and one MOU between CDCs, LSPBS, three Institutes of Higher Learning (National University of Singapore, Singapore Management University and Singapore University of Social Sciences) and one new partner Singapore Counsel Association (SCCA) on Law Awareness Weeks @ CDC. 

LAW@CDC was started to educate residents through legal talks conducted across the five districts on basic legal knowledge. These talks are held at Community Centres/Clubs (CCs) and Residents' Committee (RC) Centres. The talks are tailored for those who are not legally trained by breaking down legal jargons so that they are easy 
to understand.

SFA is a community outreach initiative that was launched in 2017.

The WeCare Arts Fund is a grant scheme in partnership between the Community Development Councils (CDCs) and the National Arts Council (NAC).  The fund aims to support Social Service Agencies (SSAs) by engaging their beneficiaries through the arts.  The CDCs and the NAC renewed their partnership on 4 September 2017 by setting aside $1 million for the WeCare Arts Fund over the next two year for programmes that make arts inclusive and promote self-confidence among the led advantages and underserved communities. The fund supports project costs that involve artists working directly with SSAs and their beneficiaries through the Performing, Visual, Literary and Multi-Disciplinary arts.
