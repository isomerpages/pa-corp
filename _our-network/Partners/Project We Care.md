<h3><strong>Hear from our Corporate Partners</strong></h3>
<h4><u>Jalan With Your Buddy @ Hong Kah North</u></h4>
<p>More than 100 residents from lower-income families enjoyed a grocery shopping
trip with an interactive learning workshop about healthier living during
the Jalan with Your Buddy initiative! Thanks to our partners such as <strong>DFI Retail Group</strong> who
sponsored the grocery shopping trip, and <strong>ADEKA (Singapore)</strong> for
their staff volunteers who were buddies of our beneficiaries, guiding them
through the workshop on healthy eating tips and choosing healthier food
options during the shopping trip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>“We are thankful to be part of this initiative organised by PA and get to connect with the beneficiaries. &nbsp;By engaging in this meaningful volunteer work, we not only contribute to our community, but also uphold ADEKA’s values and foster a compassionate and cohesive culture.”</em>

<h4><u>Bike Refresh @ Henderson-Dawson</u></h4>
<p>The holiday season got a whole lot brighter for the underprivileged residents
in Henderson-Dawson, thanks to a heartwarming partnership with <strong>HOPE Technik Pte Ltd</strong>.
&nbsp;22 unused bicycles needed some repair work and HOPE Technik, a home-grown
precision engineering company, offered their expertise and resources to
give these bicycles a new lease of life. &nbsp;These rejuvenated bicycles
were then presented to the beneficiaries during a year-end party at Henderson-Dawson
CC!</p>
<p><em>“Hope Technik has CSR initiatives aimed at giving back to the community, and refurbishing bikes for those in need is a tangible way to achieve this. &nbsp;Witnessing the outcomes of our efforts warm the hearts of our staff when they see the positive impact the refurbished bikes have on the beneficiaries. &nbsp;We are thankful to work with Project We Care, giving Hope Technik this opportunity to give back to the community while fostering stronger connections among our staff.”</em>

<h4><u>Community Action Network (CAN) School Holiday Programmes @ Kolam-Ayer</u></h4>
<p>Children from Kolam-Ayer embarked on an unforgettable experience learning
the basics of content creation with a simulated live streaming session
at Shopee’s studio! &nbsp;Organised by <strong>Sea Group</strong>, this
is part of the CAN initiative where like-minded partners gathered to co-ideate
and co-implement a series of school holiday programmes for children from
lower-income families to unlock their potential and explore their dreams
confidently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>“What started off as a discovery session for the children, turned out to be an immensely rewarding experience for our Sea Group staff volunteers too! &nbsp;We were deeply inspired by the boundless curiosity and enthusiasm of the young minds!”</em>
