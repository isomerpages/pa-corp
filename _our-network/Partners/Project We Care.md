<h4><u>Jalan With Your Buddy @ Hong Kah North</u></h4>
<p>More than 100 residents from lower-income families enjoyed a grocery shopping
trip with an interactive learning workshop about healthier living during
the Jalan with Your Buddy initiative!
<br>Thanks to our partners such as <strong>Gupta International Pte Ltd</strong> who
sponsored the grocery shopping trip, and <strong>ADEKA (Singapore)</strong> for
their staff volunteers who were buddies of our beneficiaries, guiding them
through the workshop on healthy eating tips and choosing healthier food
options during the shopping trip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>“We are thankful to be part of this initiative organised by PA and get to connect with the beneficiaries. &nbsp;By engaging in this meaningful volunteer work, we not only contribute to our community, but also uphold ADEKA’s values and foster a compassionate and cohesive culture.”</em>

<p><u>Bike Refresh @ Henderson-Dawson</u>
</p>
<p>The holiday season got a whole lot brighter for the underprivileged residents
in Henderson-Dawson, thanks to a heartwarming partnership with <strong>HOPE Technik Pte Ltd</strong>.
&nbsp;22 unused bicycles needed some repair work and HOPE Technik, a home-grown
precision engineering company, offered their expertise and resources to
give these bicycles a new lease of life. &nbsp;These rejuvenated bicycles
were then presented to the beneficiaries during a year-end party at Henderson-Dawson
CC!</p>
<p><em>“Hope Technik has CSR initiatives aimed at giving back to the community, and refurbishing bikes for those in need is a tangible way to achieve this. &nbsp;Witnessing the outcomes of our efforts warm the hearts of our staff when they see the positive impact the refurbished bikes have on the beneficiaries. &nbsp;We are thankful to work with Project We Care, giving Hope Technik this opportunity to give back to the community while fostering stronger connections among our staff.”</em>
