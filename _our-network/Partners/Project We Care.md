<h3><strong>Hear from our Corporate Partner</strong></h3>
<h4><u>Jalan With Your Buddy (Corporate Adopter edition)</u></h4>
<p>The programme pairs corporate volunteers with lower-income families for
a day of experiential learning through interactive activities and a sponsored
grocery shopping, with the objective of addressing rising living costs
and knowledge gaps<strong> </strong>on affordable healthy eating. &nbsp;The
programme has recently been enhanced to Corporate Adopter edition, where
corporates are empowered to inject their own creative ideas and involve
their employees to co-design and co-deliver the programme, fostering a
deeper sense of joint ownership in meeting community needs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2025, <strong>UOB</strong> took the lead as the first corporate adopter
of Jalan with Your Buddy @ Kembangan to co-organise the programme with
PA.&nbsp; They curated interactive workshops on healthy eating and shared
knowledge on scam awareness with the families. &nbsp;UOB also sponsored
the grocery shopping trip for the families and mobilised their staff volunteers
as shopping befrienders, guiding the residents in choosing healthier food
options during the trip.</p>
<p>“With the Jalan with Your Buddy initiative, we were not only able to deliver
a healthy shopping experience but also deliver a scam awareness programme
that helps raise awareness of this trend. And we were very thankful to
PA for giving us this opportunity.”</p>

<h4><u>ENRICH: Empower Students with Presentation Skills @ Whampoa</u></h4>
<p>With the objective to empower the community, <strong>SpeakIn</strong> collaborated
with Whampoa to equip 29 students with essential presentation skills at
a complimentary workshop. &nbsp;From mastering body language to creating
captivating visual stories, these skills not only boost the students’ public
speaking confidence but also contribute meaningfully to their personal
growth.</p>
<p><em>"We believe in the power of expert learning to uplift communities. This collaboration with PA was a heartfelt initiative to give back by equipping young students with essential communication skills that will serve them for life."</em>

<h4><u>PWC Stay Well Initiative</u></h4>
<p>Over 14,000 rental families with young children lack conducive spaces
for studying, privacy, and family bonding. &nbsp;Many of these families
live from hand-to-mouth, and often exhaust their savings when purchasing
a new flat. &nbsp;As a result, they may be unable to afford basic home
renovations needed to create a safe, dignified, and nurturing living environment.&nbsp;
The PWC Stay Well initiative provides basic renovation support for rental
families with young children who are socially and financially ready to
transition into home ownership. &nbsp;With the support from our corporate
partners, such as <strong>Force 21 International</strong>, these families
could be engaged through meaningful sessions, such as recreational activities,
outings, and museum tours, and by conducting regular milestone check-ins
with beneficiaries.</p>
<p><em>“It was truly an awesome experience getting to meet the Stay Well families personally! It's a complete joy to witness the family settling well into their newly purchased flat and enjoying family meals together every day around a proper dinner table.”</em>
</p>
