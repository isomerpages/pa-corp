<h3><strong>Hear from our Corporate Partner</strong></h3>
<h4><u>Jalan With Your Buddy (Corporate Adopter edition)</u></h4>
<p>The programme pairs corporate volunteers with lower-income families for
a day of experiential learning through interactive activities and a sponsored
grocery shopping, with the objective of addressing rising living costs
and knowledge gaps<strong> </strong>on affordable healthy eating. &nbsp;The
programme has recently been enhanced to Corporate Adopter edition, where
corporates are empowered to inject their own creative ideas and involve
their employees to co-design and co-deliver the programme, fostering a
deeper sense of joint ownership in meeting community needs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2025, <strong>UOB</strong> took the lead as the first corporate adopter
of Jalan with Your Buddy @ Kembangan to co-organise the programme with
PA.&nbsp; They curated interactive workshops on healthy eating and shared
knowledge on scam awareness with the families. &nbsp;UOB also sponsored
the grocery shopping trip for the families and mobilised their staff volunteers
as shopping befrienders, guiding the residents in choosing healthier food
options during the trip.</p>
<p>“With the Jalan with Your Buddy initiative, we were not only able to deliver
a healthy shopping experience but also deliver a scam awareness programme
that helps raise awareness of this trend. And we were very thankful to
PA for giving us this opportunity.”</p>

<h4><u>Bike Refresh @ Henderson-Dawson</u></h4>
<p>The holiday season got a whole lot brighter for the underprivileged residents
in Henderson-Dawson, thanks to a heartwarming partnership with <strong>HOPE Technik Pte Ltd</strong>.
&nbsp;22 unused bicycles needed some repair work and HOPE Technik, a home-grown
precision engineering company, offered their expertise and resources to
give these bicycles a new lease of life. &nbsp;These rejuvenated bicycles
were then presented to the beneficiaries during a year-end party at Henderson-Dawson
CC!</p>
<p><em>“Hope Technik has CSR initiatives aimed at giving back to the community, and refurbishing bikes for those in need is a tangible way to achieve this. &nbsp;Witnessing the outcomes of our efforts warm the hearts of our staff when they see the positive impact the refurbished bikes have on the beneficiaries. &nbsp;We are thankful to work with Project We Care, giving Hope Technik this opportunity to give back to the community while fostering stronger connections among our staff.”</em>

<h4><u>Community Action Network (CAN) School Holiday Programmes @ Kolam-Ayer</u></h4>
<p>Children from Kolam-Ayer embarked on an unforgettable experience learning
the basics of content creation with a simulated live streaming session
at Shopee’s studio! &nbsp;Organised by <strong>Sea Group</strong>, this
is part of the CAN initiative where like-minded partners gathered to co-ideate
and co-implement a series of school holiday programmes for children from
lower-income families to unlock their potential and explore their dreams
confidently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>“What started off as a discovery session for the children, turned out to be an immensely rewarding experience for our Sea Group staff volunteers too! &nbsp;We were deeply inspired by the boundless curiosity and enthusiasm of the young minds!”</em>
