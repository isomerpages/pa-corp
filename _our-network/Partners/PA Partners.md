#### Partners
![](/images/Our%20Network/Partners/banner%20for%20PA%20website%20partners.png)

The People's Association (PA) offers partnership opportunities for corporate and community organisations to collaborate with our extensive grassroots network to support programmes and initiatives that make a difference in the community.

Organisations can support the calendar of community events, co-create cause-based and/or interest-based programmes with PA that benefit the community. The contributions by partners will certainly go a long way to impact lives and build a great and caring home for all.

#### Why Partner PA?

#### The "Network of Partners" Approach

Our partners can **join efforts with other PA partners towards a common cause/interest to create greater social impact**, each contributing in their own ways, in accordance to the organisation’s capabilities, such as expertise, volunteers, donations in cash and/or in-kind. Together with the **extensive network of PA**, including the grassroots organisations and PA units, we can co-create meaningful programmes through concerted efforts.

#### Community Insights

Having a diverse networks in the community, PA can **share on the community needs** to better enhance the outreach programmes and partnership initiatives.

#### Sharing of Ideas and Best Practices
Platforms such as dialogue sessions and networking opportunities are available for partners to share creative ideas and best practices. This mutual learning opportunity will improve existing collaborative programmes and inspire new partnership possibilities.
