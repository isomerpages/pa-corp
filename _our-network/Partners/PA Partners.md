#### Partners

PA offers partnership opportunities for corporate and community organisations to collaborate with our extensive grassroots network to support programmes and initiatives that make a difference to the community.

Organisations can support the calendar of community events, co-create cause-based and/or interest-based programmes with PA that benefit the community. The contributions by partners will certainly go a long way to impact lives and build a great and caring home for all.

#### Why Partner PA?

#### The "Network of Partners" Approach



Our partners can cross-collaborate towards common causes and interests that generate greater social impact, each contributing in their own ways, be it through various means such as expertise, volunteers, donations in cash and/or in-kind. Together with PA's extensive network which includes our GROs and otherÂ PA units, we can co-create meaningful initiatives through concerted efforts.

#### Community Insights

With our diverse and extensive network, we are able to gather a sensing of the community's needs to better enhance targeted outreach programmes and partner initiatives.

#### Sharing of Ideas and Best Practices
Platforms such as **dialogue sessions and networking opportunities are available** for partners to share creative ideas and best practices. This mutual learning opportunity will improve existing collaborative programmes and inspire new partnership possibilities.

#### Recognition for Partners

We give recognition to strategic partners who had worked closely with PA. The **PA Community Spirit Award Scheme** is given to recognise exemplary partners who have assisted in building social capital and contributed to the community.
