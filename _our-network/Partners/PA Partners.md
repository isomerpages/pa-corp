#### Partners

PA offers partnership opportunities for corporate and community organisations to collaborate with our extensive grassroots network to support programmes and initiatives that make a difference to the community.

Organisations can support the calendar of community events, co-create cause-based and/or interest-based programmes with PA that benefit the community. The contributions by partners will certainly go a long way to impact lives and build a great and caring home for all.

#### Why Partner PA?

#### The "Network of Partners" Approach

Our partners can cross-collaborate towards common causes and interests that generate greater social impact, each contributing in their own ways, be it through various means such as expertise, volunteers, donations in cash and/or in-kind. Together with PA's extensive network which includes our GROs and other PA units, we can co-create meaningful initiatives through concerted efforts.

#### Community Insights

With our diverse and extensive network, we are able to gather a sensing of the community's needs to better enhance targeted outreach programmes and partner initiatives.

#### Sharing of Ideas and Best Practices
Platforms such as dialogue and networking sessions are available for partners to share creative ideas and best practices. These mutual learning opportunities help improve existing collaborative programmes and inspire new partnership possibilities.

#### Recognition of Partners
