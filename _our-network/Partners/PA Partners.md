<p>PA offers partnership opportunities for corporate and community organisations
to collaborate with our extensive grassroots network to support programmes
and initiatives that make a difference to the community.</p>
<p>Organisations can support the calendar of community events, co-create
cause-based and/or interest-based programmes with PA that benefit the community.
The contributions by partners will certainly go a long way to impact lives
and build a great and caring home for all.</p>
<h4>Why Partner PA?</h4>

<h4>The "Network of Partners" Approach</h4>
<p>Our partners can cross-collaborate towards common causes and interests
that generate greater social impact, each contributing in their own ways,
be it through various means such as expertise, volunteers, donations in
cash and/or in-kind. Together with PA's extensive network which includes
our GROs and other PA units, we can co-create meaningful initiatives through
concerted efforts.</p>
