WeCare PALs are corporate and community partners of PA, working hand in hand with the PA and its grassroots networks, with the aim to create a caring society in Singapore. Through the avenue of any cause-driven programme, PA hopes to enable WeCare PALs to jointly play a meaningful role in helping the underprivileged, disadvantaged and/or the special needs citizens and deepening the connection with the community.
