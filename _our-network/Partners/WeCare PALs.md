<p>WeCare PALs are our corporate and community partners, working hand-in-hand
with us and our grassroots networks, with the aim to create a caring society.
Through cause-driven programmes, PA hopes to enable WeCare PALs to jointly
play a meaningful role in helping the underprivileged, disadvantaged and/or
special needs citizens to deepen the connections with the community.</p>
