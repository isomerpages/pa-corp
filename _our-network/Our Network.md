PA and its network of grassroots organisations (GROs) promote national unity by bringing people together, bridging communities, fostering new friendships and creating stronger bonds. Through our network, we strive to build a resilient and cohesive community that stands together, regardless of diversity and differences within the community, to achieve “one people, one Singapore”. Find the connections that you need to be in touch with your community, to get the support you need, and to enjoy a more integrated and fulfilling life in Singapore.
