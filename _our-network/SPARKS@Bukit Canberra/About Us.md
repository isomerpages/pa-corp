<p><strong>About SPARKS@Bukit Canberra</strong>
<br>SPARKS@Bukit Canberra, which is housed at the Bukit Canberra Integrated
Hub, serves as a one-stop volunteer centre. It promotes community bonding
through meaningful cause-based outreach projects. Residents and schools
can either join existing projects or co-create localised projects with
our youth leaders.
<br>
<br>SPARKS@Bukit Canberra also works with corporate organisations to customise
corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects to reach out to the needy
and vulnerable groups in Sembawang GRC. It also collaborates with corporate
partners to organise industry talks and dialogues for PMETs, providing
a platform for residents to network with one another and with industry
gurus.</p>
<p><strong>Our Belief</strong>
<br>All of us have 168 hours per week. Through the 2: 168 movement, we invite
you to set aside 2 hours for a good cause. Letâ€™s ignite the kampung spirit
by a simple gesture of setting aside 2 hours for a good cause.</p>
