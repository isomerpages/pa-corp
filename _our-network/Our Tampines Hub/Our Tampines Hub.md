Our Tampines Hub (OTH) is Singapore’s largest integrated community and lifestyle hub, bringing together multiple agencies and offering a comprehensive range of services and facilities.

Led by People’s Association, OTH represents a new model of a community-focused development, celebrating the full sense of community through meaningful engagement, enriching residents through multiple experiences and empowering them to stake ownership of the hub, so as to build a robust identity for Tampines and a truly sustainable community.


OTH provides a common secular space for residents and visitors of different backgrounds, races, ages and public and private estates to come together, interact and bond.

 In addition to building social cohesion and racial harmony, it caters for a deepened engagement amongst Tampines residents and Hub visitors.
 
 OTH integrates the physical facilities, management and programming of multiple agencies. It is currently working toward achieving PA, MCCY/SSC/NA/NHB, NLB, MOH, NEA, HDB, MOH’s key priorities and initiatives to provide better services, widen community outreach and engagement and build community ownership in programming for its residents and visitors.

The integration of the Community Gallery with the Regional Library at OTH has enabled NHB to reach out to new audiences in the heartlands and raise awareness of arts, culture and heritage amongst the surrounding community; strengthen the sense of pride and belonging to the spaces they live in; engender greater ownership of our heritage amongst Singaporeans; thereby fostering a greater sense of nationhood and identity in our people. This is a joint effort with NHB, NLB and Tampines Grassroots Organisations (GROs).

Conceptualised with inputs from 15,000 Tampines residents, Our Tampines Hub is designed with residents, for residents. It is the future of Tampines that offers greater convenience, a full spectrum of activities, facilities and services to cater to residents and visitors of all ages and lifestyle preferences, ensuring it serves all members within our community.
