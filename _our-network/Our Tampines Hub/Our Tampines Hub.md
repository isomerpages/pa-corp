Led by People’s Association, OTH represents a new model of a community-focused development, celebrating the full sense of community through meaningful engagement, enriching residents through multiple experiences and empowering them to stake ownership of the hub, so as to build a robust identity for Tampines and a truly sustainable community.

It is the future of Tampines that offers greater convenience, a full spectrum of activities, facilities and services to cater to residents and visitors of all ages and lifestyle preferences, ensuring it serves all members within our community.
