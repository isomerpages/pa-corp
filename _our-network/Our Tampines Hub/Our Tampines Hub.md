Led by People’s Association, OTH represents a new model of a community-focused development, celebrating the full sense of community through meaningful engagement, enriching residents through multiple experiences and empowering them to stake ownership of the hub, so as to build a robust identity for Tampines and a truly sustainable community.

It is currently working toward achieving PA, MCCY/SSC/NA/NHB, NLB, MOH, NEA, HDB, MOH’s key priorities and initiatives to&nbsp;**provide better services, widen community outreach and engagement and build community ownership in programming for its residents and visitors**.

The&nbsp;**integration of the Community Gallery with the Regional Library at OTH**&nbsp;has enabled NHB to reach out to new audiences in the heartlands and raise awareness of arts, culture and heritage amongst the surrounding community; strengthen the sense of pride and belonging to the spaces they live in; engender greater ownership of our heritage amongst Singaporeans; thereby&nbsp;**fostering a greater sense of nationhood and identity in our people**. This is a joint effort with NHB, NLB and Tampines Grassroots Organisations (GROs).

It is the future of Tampines that offers greater convenience, a full spectrum of activities, facilities and services to cater to residents and visitors of all ages and lifestyle preferences, ensuring it serves all members within our community.
