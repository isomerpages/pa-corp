The development is guided by three principles: resident-centricity, optimisation of resources and infrastructure, as well as encouraging community ownership through resident engagement.

As a resident-centric development, the 5 “E”s of a participatory design process was employed from the start to ensure purposeful inclusion of the community in the design process.

**Engage**: Create opportunities for two-way exchanges between stakeholders and residents through social media, focus groups and block parties;

**Enrich**: Enhance information exchanged between the project team and community so short term inconveniences are better managed against the long term benefits for the community;

**Empathy**: Being sensitive and conscious toward aspirations of the community, thereby prioritising collective needs and wants;

**Empower**: The long term sustenance of a development of this scale means engendering a sense of ownership amongst residents through participation;

**Evaluate**: The ongoing process of constantly taking stock and engaging with residents to ensure continual refinement of the hub.
