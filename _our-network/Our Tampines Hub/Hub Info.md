<p>OTH's development is guided by three principles: resident-centricity,
optimisation of resources and infrastructure, as well as encouraging community
ownership through resident engagement.</p>
<p>As a resident-centric development, the 5 “E”s of a participatory design
process was employed from the start to ensure purposeful inclusion of the
community in the design process.</p>
<p><strong>Engage</strong>: Create opportunities for two-way exchanges between
stakeholders and residents through social media, focus groups and block
parties;</p>
<p><strong>Enrich</strong>: Enhance information exchanged between the project
team and community so short term inconveniences are better managed against
the long term benefits for the community;</p>
<p><strong>Empathy</strong>: Being sensitive and conscious toward aspirations
of the community, thereby prioritising collective needs and wants;</p>
<p><strong>Empower</strong>: The long term sustenance of a development of
this scale means engendering a sense of ownership amongst residents through
participation;</p>
<p><strong>Evaluate</strong>: The ongoing process of constantly taking stock
and engaging with residents to ensure continual refinement of the hub.</p>

<h3>Tampines Kindness Movement</h3>
<p>The Tampines Kindness Movement (TKM) is <strong>an offshoot of the Singapore Kindness Movement</strong>&nbsp;and
focuses on building a community culture that practices graciousness toward
neighbour and environment. OTH is the crucible for the TKM and supports
this by promoting ground-up initiatives of Tampines residents with its
Ambassadors i.e. volunteers, across different facets of its operations.</p>
<p>The objective is to engender in all visitors a sense of responsibility
toward building this culture because everyone plays a part in contributing
toward the creation of a&nbsp;<strong>kinder and more gracious culture toward each other and the environment.</strong>
