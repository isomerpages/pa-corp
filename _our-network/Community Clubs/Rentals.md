<p>Community Clubs (CCs) are meeting grounds for all residents, offering
a venue for activities within the community. Our CCs bring people together
through a variety of programmes, from youth to active-ageing; and from
classroom-based courses to sporting and fitness activities, bazaar sales
and parties. CCs also offer a wide-range of facilities, from basic ones
like basketball and badminton courts to more modern ones like dance studios
and gymnasiums.</p>
