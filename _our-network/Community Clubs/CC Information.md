<p>Community Clubs (CCs) are common spaces for people of all races to come
together, build friendships and promote social bonding. CCs also connect
residents and the Government by providing relevant information and gathering
feedback on national concerns and policies. Each CC serves about 15,000
households or an average of 50,000 people.</p>
