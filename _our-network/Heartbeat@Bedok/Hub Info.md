#### Offering More Services and Amenities Under One Roof

In 2007, along with the ‘Remaking Our Heartland’ (ROH) initiative, the idea of moving the then 26-year-old Kampong Chai Chee Community Centre (CC) into an integrated hub with amenities that will bring greater convenience and amenities to East Coast residents and rejuvenate Bedok was mooted. The Heartbeat@Bedok, which has multiple partners located under one roof and offering community facilities such as ActiveSG East Bedok Sports Centre, Bedok Public Library, Kampong Chai Chee Community Club, SingHealth Polyclinic and a Senior Care Centre, was completed in 2017.

Bounce Bags is a community bag-share campaign for shoppers who have not carried a reusable bag for their purchases. This novel bag-share project is a platform to facilitate re-usable bag sharing. This rack, containing reusable bags kindly donated by residents is installed at the atrium for residents to freely take in order to reduce their usage of single-use plastic bags.  We hope that by being involved in the action, East Coast residents will be able to make a transition towards a plastic bag free lifestyle.  </p></div>
