#### Offering More Services and Amenities Under One Roof

In 2007, along with the ‘Remaking Our Heartland’ (ROH) initiative, the idea of moving the then 26-year-old Kampong Chai Chee Community Centre (CC) into an integrated hub with amenities that will bring greater convenience and amenities to East Coast residents and rejuvenate Bedok was mooted. The Heartbeat@Bedok, which has multiple partners located under one roof and offering community facilities such as ActiveSG East Bedok Sports Centre, Bedok Public Library, Kampong Chai Chee Community Club, SingHealth Polyclinic and a Senior Care Centre, was completed in 2017.

Heartbeat@Bedok has achieved many distinguished awards, namely,

#### Our Green and Sustainability Approach

   

In line with the East Coast Plan, Heartbeat@Bedok has introduced several eco-sustainable initiatives to enable the individuals to be conscious about how their actions can impact the environment and hopefully, on their own, take steps to pick up a more environmentally conscious habit. 

(A) Bounce Bag Point

Bounce Bags is a community bag-share campaign for shoppers who have not carried a reusable bag for their purchases. This novel bag-share project is a platform to facilitate re-usable bag sharing. This rack, containing reusable bags kindly donated by residents is installed at the atrium for residents to freely take in order to reduce their usage of single-use plastic bags.  We hope that by being involved in the action, East Coast residents will be able to make a transition towards a plastic bag free lifestyle.  

(B) ‘Skip The Straw’

The ‘Skip the Straw’ initiative is a collaboration with the Food and Beverage tenants located within Heartbeat@Bedok that aims to minimise the use of non-biodegradable straws to reduce the release of harmful gases into the environment. The straws will only be made available upon request.

(C) Our Green Space

Our Green Space was officially launched in Year 2021. Till date, this recycling collection point has been very well-received by the residents and has collected more than 30,000 tones of wastes including electronic, paper, metal and plastic.
