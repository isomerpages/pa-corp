Neighbourhood Committees (NCs) were formed in June 1998 to encourage active citizenry and foster stronger community bonds within private housing estates. NCs also work with various government agencies to improve the social and physical environment in their private housing estates.


NCsâ€™ functions are to:

* Promote neighbourliness, harmony and cohesiveness amongst residents;
* Connect with and make recommendations to government authorities on the needs and aspirations of residents;
* Disseminate information and obtain feedback on government policies and actions from the residents; and
* Foster good citizenship amongst residents.

Have a say in your estate. Join your NCs as a [volunteer](/engage/be-our-volunteer).

#### One Connect

The People's Association (PA) One Connect programme is a citizen-centric community programme for residents living in private estates, where they can reach out to their Neighbourhood Committees (NCs) to provide suggestions to improve their estates and to find out more information about the community acitivites taking place around their neighbourhood.
