As a leading youth organisation, the People’s Association Youth Movement (PAYM) has been reaching out to youths in Singapore since its inception in 1971. It offers a wide spectrum of interesting and meaningful programmes and initiatives to excite, engage and and empower the youths in creating a vibrant youth community. The PAYM network currently consists of over 90 Youth Networks based at the CCs.

#### PAYM’s Youth Engagement Framework

The Youth Networks under the umbrella of PAYM build social capital amongst youths, and through the youth by helping them to enrich the lives of others. The PAYM’s youth engagement framework includes programmes targeting youth profiles, interest-driven activities to meet the diverse interests of youths, opportunities for youths to do their part for the community, and highpoint engagement events to bring more youths together. A multi-prong approach is adopted for PAYM’s youth engagement framework.

The PAYM reaches out to youths in secondary schools via the Service-Learning Champion (SLC) Scheme, which aims to promote holistic development in youths by enabling them to achieve personal, character and academic development, and acquire values, life skills, a sense of civil responsibility and commitment through being involved in community service.

A strong emphasis on personal development and hands-on experiences greatly enhance the learning experience of students. SLCs are encouraged to organise a wide variety of service activities to meet the needs of their community, and to tap on their own talents and initiatives in the process.

#### Empowering Youth 

**Youth Chapters**

In addition to involving youths in the Youth Networks, the Youth Chapters at the Residents’ Committees and Neighbourhood Committees is another key initiative to facilitate deeper local youth engagement as it will give young residents a chance to get to know each other and do meaningful activities together.  
  
The Youth Chapters bring like-minded youths together through interest groups, bring about an impact to the needy residents through community service programmes and organise activities for fellow youths and residents.

The **Community Leadership Programme (CLP)** is developed to introduce students from Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL) to community work and a diverse range of volunteer activities

Students will be attached to the Youth Networks (YN) and mentored by experienced YN leaders. Students will embark on a journey of experiential learning, community projects, leadership workshops, house-to-house visits, dialogue sessions and participation in national campaigns – PAYM Loves Red and Community YOUthCare Festival.

Through CLP, the students will not only hone their leadership skills but also cultivate a sense of appreciation on the importance of bridging diverse communities.

Interest groups are formed by the youths for the youths at the CCs where youths can meet like-minded peers and pursue their interests together.

These interest groups are excellent platforms for youths to interact regularly, share resources and forge meaningful friendships.

Popular interest groups include beach volleyball, archery, cheerleading, yo-yo, performing arts and astronomy.

#### Community Service Programmes

#### Forum and Dialogue Series

Community YOUthCare Festival, an island-wide community service initiative, was mooted in 2011 encourage more youths to come together to care for their community. Our youths have since implemented regular sustainable community service programmes such as weekly reading classes for children from the lower-income families, environmental outreach drives, and weekly free meal distribution to the seniors in need of support, and mental wellness initiatives.
