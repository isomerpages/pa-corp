#### People's Association Youth Movement

As a leading youth organisation, the People’s Association Youth Movement (PAYM) has been reaching out to youths in Singapore from the ages of 12 to 35 since 1971. Over 40 years, the PAYM has been offering a wide spectrum of interesting and meaningful programmes and initiatives to excite, engage and and empower the youths in creating a vibrant youth community.


This communal bonding is further reinforced through the Youth Executive Committees (YECs) at the Community Clubs (CCs). Youth Club members are elected into the YECs which involve them in various programmes and activities, and with the grassroots organisations to implement community development projects for residents in their respective constituencies.

The PAYM network currently consists of 107 Youth Clubs based at the CCs. These Youth Clubs are managed by 102 YECs comprising young grassroots leaders who ensure programmes and activities are always current and innovative.

#### PAYM’s Youth Engagement Framework

The YECs under the umbrella of PAYM build social capital amongst youths, and through the youth by helping them to enrich the lives of others. The PAYM’s youth engagement framework includes programmes targeting youth profiles, interest-driven activities to meet the diverse interests of youths, opportunities for youths to do their part for the community, and highpoint engagement events to bring more youths together. A multi-prong approach is adopted for PAYM’s youth engagement framework.

##### Engage Youth Since Young 
**PAYM Service-Learning Champions**

The PAYM reaches out to youths in secondary schools via the Service-Learning Champion (SLC) Scheme, which aims to promote holistic development in youths by enabling them to achieve personal, character and academic development, and acquire values, life skills, a sense of civil responsibility and commitment through being involved in community service.

A strong emphasis on personal development and hands-on experiences greatly enhance the learning experience of students. SLCs are encouraged to organise a wide variety of service activities to meet the needs of their community, and to tap on their own talents and initiatives in the process.

#### Empowering Youth 

**Youth Chapters

In addition to involving youths in the YECs, the Youth Chapters at the Residents’ Committees and Neighbourhood Committees is another key initiative to facilitate deeper local youth engagement as it will give young residents a chance to get to know each other and do meaningful activities together.

The Youth Chapters bring like-minded youths together through interest groups, bring about an impact to the needy residents through community service programmes and organise activities for fellow youths and residents.

The Community Leadership Programme (CLP) is developed to expose students to grassroots work and a diverse range of volunteer activities.

Students will be attached to the Youth Executive Committees (YECs) and mentored by experienced YEC leaders. Students will be challenged to step out of their comfort zones through a journey of experiential learning, community projects, leadership workshops, house-to-house visits, dialogue sessions and participation in national campaigns – PAYM Loves Red and YOUths Care @ PAYM.

Through CLP, the students will not only hone their leadership skills but also cultivate a sense of appreciation on the importance of bridging diverse communities.

##### Engage Youth through Interests/ Causes 
**Interest Groups

Interest groups are formed by the youths for the youths at the CCs where youths can meet like-minded peers and pursue their interests together.

These interest groups are excellent platforms for youths to interact regularly, share resources and forge meaningful friendships.

Popular interest groups include beach volleyball, archery, cheerleading, yo-yo, performing arts and astronomy.

##### Community Service Programmes

To build a civic-conscious youth community, the PAYM also provides platforms for youths to contribute to the wider community.

Currently, our youths have implemented more than 100 sustainable community service programmes such as weekly reading classes for children from the lower-income families, environmental outreach drives, and weekly free meal distribution to the needy and less mobile elderly, and environmental outreach activities.

#### Forum and Dialogue Series
The PAYM engages both schooling and working youths and heightens their sense of belonging in the community by consulting their views on current issues and national policies through the different series of forum and dialogue lined up every year.

YOUTHSpeak on Budget engages youth from our youth communities to gather feedback on Budget. This post-Budget dialogue is held annually after Budget Day as a platform for our youths to share their feedback on the budget initiatives shared by the Finance Minister during Budget Day. Through this process, PAYM hopes to deepen youths’ interest, knowledge and insight on current affairs, as well as understand the trade-off in policy-making.

The youths will have the opportunity to meet and network with like-minded youths from the various institutions and organisations, as well as to share their views with fellow youths and our special guests.

Voices of Youth is a post- National Day Rally (NDR)  forum programme series that is held every year to gather feedback from youths on Prime Minister's NDR speech.  The discussions enabled youths to engage constructively and provided a platform for them to share their feedback on the issues raised at the NDR . This series aims to strengthen the government to youth connectivity by deepening the youths' interest, knowledge and insight on current affairs, as well as understand the trade-off in policy-making.

Conversation with Leaders of Tomorrow Policy Forum series is one of PAYM’s latest initiatives to promote better understanding of government policies and its trade-offs among youths from the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). The forum invites IHL youths to share their views on current issues and national policies with representatives from the government, private and academic sectors. The feedback received would be channelled to the relevant agencies for consideration and implementation where appropriate.

##### Excite Youths with High-Point Events

Since 2008, youths have come forward to take charge in creating their own special showcases, taking on roles that see them lead fellow volunteers and performers, and even design their own costumes in the annual extravaganza of Chingay Parade

For Chingay Parade 2015, the PAYM anchored the finale of the Parade, showcasing the dynamism and strength of the youths. 1,000 youths performed with a compliment of 150 tree props across a sector of 360 meters in length and 12 meters in width at the F1 Pit. The PAYM contingent was awarded the ‘Best Audience Contingent’ and ‘Champion of the Year Award.

##### PAYM Loves Red

The “PAYM Loves Red” supports and encourages all youths to organise meaningful and interesting National Day celebratory activities in the months of July and August. Through these projects, youths can connect with their peers and local residents, and together, display the vibrant energy, passion and their patriotism toward the nation in creative and unique ways.

The focus for “SG50 PAYM Loves Red” is for youths to embrace and actualize the values and visions from the Youth Aspirations for Singapore Campaign in their ‘SG50 PAYM Loves Red’ projects. As part of SG50 celebration, projects undertaken by the youths and participants would allow them to reflect on the reasons for our nation’s success and the factors underpinning it (e.g. through the hard work and determination of our founding fathers and pioneer generation and the values/beliefs that have enabled us to succeed).

#### YOUths Care @ PAYM

‘YOUths Care @ People’s Association Youth Movement (PAYM)’, an island-wide community service initiative, was mooted in 2011 to encourage more youths to come together to care for the less privileged in our community. In the month of November and December 2014, more than 6,800 youths spread love and joy to more than 13,500 beneficiaries through 104 programmes island-wide.

In celebration of the nation’s Golden Jubilee, ‘SG50 YOUths Care @ PAYM’ will take place for three months, from April to June 2015. For this special year, YECs, RC/NC Youth Chapters, IHLs and SLCs are outreaching together as a PAYM, to help 50 beneficiary organisations in conjunction with Singapore’s 50th birthday.
