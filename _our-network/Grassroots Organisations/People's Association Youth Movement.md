#### People's Association Youth Movement

As a leading youth organisation, the People’s Association Youth Movement (PAYM) has been reaching out to youths in Singapore from the ages of 12 to 35 since 1971. Over 40 years, the PAYM has been offering a wide spectrum of interesting and meaningful programmes and initiatives to excite, engage and and empower the youths in creating a vibrant youth community.


This communal bonding is further reinforced through the Youth Executive Committees (YECs) at the Community Clubs (CCs). Youth Club members are elected into the YECs which involve them in various programmes and activities, and with the grassroots organisations to implement community development projects for residents in their respective constituencies.

The PAYM network currently consists of 107 Youth Clubs based at the CCs. These Youth Clubs are managed by 102 YECs comprising young grassroots leaders who ensure programmes and activities are always current and innovative.

#### PAYM’s Youth Engagement Framework

The YECs under the umbrella of PAYM build social capital amongst youths, and through the youth by helping them to enrich the lives of others. The PAYM’s youth engagement framework includes programmes targeting youth profiles, interest-driven activities to meet the diverse interests of youths, opportunities for youths to do their part for the community, and highpoint engagement events to bring more youths together. A multi-prong approach is adopted for PAYM’s youth engagement framework.

The PAYM reaches out to youths in secondary schools via the Service-Learning Champion (SLC) Scheme, which aims to promote holistic development in youths by enabling them to achieve personal, character and academic development, and acquire values, life skills, a sense of civil responsibility and commitment through being involved in community service.

A strong emphasis on personal development and hands-on experiences greatly enhance the learning experience of students. SLCs are encouraged to organise a wide variety of service activities to meet the needs of their community, and to tap on their own talents and initiatives in the process.

#### Empowering Youth

In addition to involving youths in the YECs, the Youth Chapters at the Residents’ Committees and Neighbourhood Committees is another key initiative to facilitate deeper local youth engagement as it will give young residents a chance to get to know each other and do meaningful activities together.

The Youth Chapters bring like-minded youths together through interest groups, bring about an impact to the needy residents through community service programmes and organise activities for fellow youths and residents.

The Community Leadership Programme (CLP) is developed to expose students to grassroots work and a diverse range of volunteer activities.

Students will be attached to the Youth Executive Committees (YECs) and mentored by experienced YEC leaders. Students will be challenged to step out of their comfort zones through a journey of experiential learning, community projects, leadership workshops, house-to-house visits, dialogue sessions and participation in national campaigns – PAYM Loves Red and YOUths Care @ PAYM.

Through CLP, the students will not only hone their leadership skills but also cultivate a sense of appreciation on the importance of bridging diverse communities.

##### Engage Youth through Interests/ Causes 
**Interest Groups

Interest groups are formed by the youths for the youths at the CCs where youths can meet like-minded peers and pursue their interests together.

These interest groups are excellent platforms for youths to interact regularly, share resources and forge meaningful friendships.

Popular interest groups include beach volleyball, archery, cheerleading, yo-yo, performing arts and astronomy.

##### Community Service Programmes

To build a civic-conscious youth community, the PAYM also provides platforms for youths to contribute to the wider community.

Currently, our youths have implemented more than 100 sustainable community service programmes such as weekly reading classes for children from the lower-income families, environmental outreach drives, and weekly free meal distribution to the needy and less mobile elderly, and environmental outreach activities.
