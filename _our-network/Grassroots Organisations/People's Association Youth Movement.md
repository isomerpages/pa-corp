<p>As a leading youth organisation, the People’s Association Youth Movement
(PAYM) has been reaching out to youths in Singapore since its inception
in 1971. It offers a wide spectrum of interesting and meaningful programmes
and initiatives to excite, engage and empower the youths in creating a
vibrant youth community. The PAYM network currently consists of over 90
Youth Networks based at the CCs.</p>
<h4>PAYM’s Youth Engagement Framework</h4>
<p>The Youth Networks under the umbrella of PAYM build social capital amongst
youths, and through the youth by helping them to enrich the lives of others.
The PAYM’s youth engagement framework includes programmes targeting youth
profiles, interest-driven activities to meet the diverse interests of youths,
opportunities for youths to do their part for the community, and highpoint
engagement events to bring more youths together. A multi-prong approach
is adopted for PAYM’s youth engagement framework.</p>

<p>The PAYM reaches out to youths in secondary schools via the Service-Learning
Champion (SLC) Scheme, which aims to promote holistic development in youths
by enabling them to achieve personal, character and academic development,
and acquire values, life skills, a sense of civil responsibility and commitment
through being involved in community service.</p>
<p>A strong emphasis on personal development and hands-on experiences greatly
enhance the learning experience of students. SLCs are encouraged to organise
a wide variety of service activities to meet the needs of their community,
and to tap on their own talents and initiatives in the process.</p>

<h4>Empowering Youth</h4>

<p>
<br>In addition to involving youths in the Youth Networks, the Youth Chapters
at the Residents’ Committees and Neighbourhood Committees is another key
initiative to facilitate deeper local youth engagement as it will give
young residents a chance to get to know each other and do meaningful activities
together.</p>
<p>The Youth Chapters bring like-minded youths together through interest
groups, bring about an impact to the needy residents through community
service programmes and organise activities for fellow youths and residents.</p>

<p>Interest groups are formed by the youths for the youths at the CCs where
youths can meet like-minded peers and pursue their interests together.</p>

share resources and forge meaningful friendships.</p>
<p>Popular interest groups include beach volleyball, archery, cheerleading,
yo-yo, performing arts and astronomy.</p>
