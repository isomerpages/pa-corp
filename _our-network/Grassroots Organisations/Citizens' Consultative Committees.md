<p>As part of our ongoing efforts to build a "We First" society, 1,000 volunteers
will be trained as skilled community facilitators through the newly launched
Community Facilitators Programme. From 2026, PA will partner Institutes
of Higher Learning (IHLs) to systematically train community facilitators,
starting with the CCCs, ensuring every constituency has leaders equipped
with advanced training in community engagement and facilitation skills.
These skills will enable grassroots leaders to identify the strengths and
interests that already exist in their community and help residents connect
and collaborate around what they care about.</p>
<p>The Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs) is a vital bridge between
the people and the Government. The CCCs plan and lead major grassroots
activities within the constituency, oversee local assistance programmes,
and organise major fund-raising projects and national campaigns.</p>
