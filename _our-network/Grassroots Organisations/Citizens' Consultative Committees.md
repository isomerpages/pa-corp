### Celebrating Citizens’ Consultative Committees’ 60th Anniversary 

Established in 1965, the Citizens’ Consultative Committees (CCCs) are the apex grassroots organisations under the People’s Association, working closely with fellow grassroots organisations to serve residents’ diverse needs. In 2025, we celebrate the CCCs’ 60th Anniversary of service to the community in nurturing a sense of belonging and care. 

Journey through the CCCs' milestone community initiatives over the past 60 years, spanning arts and culture, sports, and social services.

As part of our ongoing efforts to build a "We First" society, 1,000 volunteers will be trained as skilled community facilitators through the newly launched Community Facilitators Programme. From 2026, PA will partner Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to systematically train community facilitators, starting with the CCCs, ensuring every constituency has leaders equipped with advanced training in community engagement and facilitation skills. These skills will enable grassroots leaders to identify the strengths and interests that already exist in their community and help residents connect and collaborate around what they care about.

The Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs) is a vital bridge between the people and the Government. The CCCs plan and lead major grassroots activities within the constituency, oversee local assistance programmes, and organise major fund-raising projects and national campaigns.
