#### Women's Integration Network Council


The Women’s Integration Network (WIN) Council was established in March 1995 with representatives from the Women’s Executive Committees (WECs). The Council sets directions for WECs to inspire more women towards community leadership and contribution.

The mission of the WIN Council is to:

* Win women over to join grassroots organisations (GROs);
* Inspire women to take leadership positions in GROs; and
* Nurture women to play an active role in society and the community.
