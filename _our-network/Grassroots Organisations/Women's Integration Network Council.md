The Women’s Integration Network (WIN) Council was established in March 1995 with representatives from the Women’s Executive Committees (WECs). The Council sets directions for WECs to inspire more women towards community leadership and contribution.

The mission of the WIN Council is to:

* Win women over to join grassroots organisations (GROs);
* Inspire women to take leadership positions in GROs; and
* Nurture women to play an active role in society and the community.

**International Women’s Day (IWD)**

The PA WIN Council celebrates IWD every year with a different theme recognise the contributions of women to society and show care for women in the community

In 2024, PA WIN Council organised a day out for caregivers of persons with mental health conditions and their loved ones on 16 March 2024. Caregivers shared their caregiving journey and how joining the WIN Caregivers Network helped them to connect with and be supported by other caregivers.
        
The WIN Caregivers Network was launched in collaboration with National Council of Social Service and Caregivers Alliance Limited (CAL) in April 2022. There are now more than 400 caregivers who have joined the Network.
