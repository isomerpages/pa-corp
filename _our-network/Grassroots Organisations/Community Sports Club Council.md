Our Community Sports Club Council (CSC Council) was inaugurated in June 2006. The CSC Council’s key role is to foster community bonding through sports in collaboration with the Community Sports Clubs (CSCs), other grassroots organisations and other sporting bodies. The CSC Council also works toward enlarging the common space for residents through various programmes such as the Passion Children’s Football Programme, the Singapore Community Games (SCG) and the newly included Community Sports Day (CSD).

If you would like to organise or participate in sports activities, you can join our CSCs by contacting your nearest [CC](https://www.onepa.gov.sg/cc).
