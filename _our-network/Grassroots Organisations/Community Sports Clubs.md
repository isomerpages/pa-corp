#### Community Sports Clubs

The People’s Association (PA) works through Community Sports Clubs (CSCs) to foster community bonding through a wide array of sports activities for residents to participate and interact with one another.

The CSCs’ flagship programmes include the PAssion Children’s Football Programme, the Singapore Community Games (SCG) and the newly included Community Sports Day (CSD). Other activities organised by the CSCs include mass walks, mass swims, sports carnivals, bowling, badminton, football and sepak takraw. Altogether, there are 89 CSCs which are made up of volunteers who work with the PA to promote social cohesion, racial harmony and community bonding amongst residents.
