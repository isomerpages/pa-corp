The Residents’ Committees (RCs) were introduced in 1978 to promote neighbourliness, racial harmony and community cohesiveness amongst residents within their respective RC zones in Housing and Development Board estates. Run by residents for residents, RCs also work closely with other grassroots organisations like the Citizens’ Consultative Committees and various government agencies to improve the physical environment and safety of their respective precincts.

The functions of RCs are to:

* Promote neighbourliness, harmony and cohesiveness amongst residents;
* Liaise with and make recommendations to government authorities on the needs and aspirations of residents;
* Disseminate information and gather feedback on government policies and actions from residents; and
* Promote good citizenship amongst residents.

#### How to join the RCs
Volunteer or be nominated by residents under the Residents Nomination Scheme. This scheme gives residents the opportunity to have a say on who becomes part of their RCs.

Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents, aged 18 and above and living within the RCs Zone, can be nominated to join the RCs.
