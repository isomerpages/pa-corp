<h3>Grassroots Organisations</h3>
<p>The Peopleâ€™s Association (PA) has a network of more than 2,000 grassroots
organisations (GROs). They are managed by volunteers appointed by the PA.
Through their involvement in the GROs, these volunteers help the PA achieve
its mission of building and bridging communities to achieve one people,
one Singapore. They bring people of different backgrounds together by organising
a wide range of programmes for residents to meet and interact, encouraging
community involvement, raising awareness about community issues, explaining
government policies and gathering feedback, as well as helping those in
need, so as to strengthen racial harmony and social cohesion in our community.</p>
