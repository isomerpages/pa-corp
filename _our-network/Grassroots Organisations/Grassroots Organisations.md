### Grassroots Organisations

The Peopleâ€™s Association (PA) has a network of more than 2,000 grassroots organisations (GROs). They are managed by volunteers appointed by the PA. Through their involvement in the GROs, these volunteers help the PA achieve its mission of building and bridging communities to achieve one people, one Singapore. They bring people of different backgrounds together by organising a wide range of programmes for residents to meet and interact, encouraging community involvement, raising awareness about community issues, explaining government policies and gathering feedback, as well as helping those in need, so as to strengthen racial harmony and social cohesion in our community.

 [Join us](/engage/be-our-volunteer) as a volunteer and help build a caring community and great home for everyone. Visit  [OnePA](https://www.onepa.gov.sg/rc) to search for your nearest RC/RN/NC.
