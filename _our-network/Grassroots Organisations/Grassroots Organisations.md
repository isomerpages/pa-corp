<h3>Grassroots Organisations</h3>
<p>The Peopleâ€™s Association (PA) has a network of more than 2,000 grassroots
organisations (GROs). They are managed by volunteers appointed by the PA.
Through their involvement in the GROs, these volunteers help the PA achieve
its mission of nurturing community participation to build a caring and
united Singapore.</p>
<p>PA's volunteers play the following roles in the community:</p>
