<h4>Bridging the Government and the People</h4>
<p>The People’s Association (PA) is a statutory board under the Ministry
of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY). It was set up to foster racial
harmony and strengthen social cohesion, and to serve as the bridge between
the Government and the people. PA will communicate and explain Government
policies to residents, help them understand the policies and at the same
time, relay public feedback and sentiments to the Government so government
policies better address the needs of Singaporeans.</p>
<p>The PA appoints Grassroots Advisers (GRAs) to guide its grassroots organisations
in engagement and outreach efforts. One of the key roles that GRAs play
is to walk the ground with grassroots leaders and volunteers to explain
Government policies and initiatives and understand residents’ concerns
and feedback.</p>
<p>Therefore, GRAs must be able to share the Government of the day’s vision
and objectives, and to explain the policies to residents.</p>
