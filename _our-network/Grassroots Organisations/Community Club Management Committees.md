Our Community Club Management Committees (CCMCs) help build, manage and maintain all our Community Clubs (CCs). Made up of volunteers who work with our staff, the CCMCs meet regularly to plan and organise innovative programmes that help bring residents together at the CCs to interact and forge friendships.

#### What role does the CCMCs play?

Our CCMCs promote racial harmony and social cohesion through the various cultural, educational, recreational, sporting, social and other community-based activities organised specially for residents. Our CCMCs manage all the CCs, ensure that all CCs keep up with the expectations and needs of residents, and organise creative and innovative courses and activities for residents in the community.

#### Executive Committees
To help the CCMCs achieve their objectives, various executive committees were set up to focus on different areas. These executive committees are under the purview of the CCMCs and help ensure that different segments of residents are well looked after.

Join the various activities organised by these executive committees at your [nearest CC](https://www.onepa.gov.sg/cc)

#### Senior Citizens' Executive Committees
The Senior Citizens’ Executive Committee (EC) plans and organises a wide array of activities and courses to enrich the life experiences of seniors. These include arts and culture, lifestyle pursuits, lifelong learning, and sports and wellness programmes. The SCEC aims to engage and empower seniors to lead active, healthy and meaningful lives in the community.

#### Women's Executive Committees
Women's Executive Committees (WECs) play an important role in galvanising women from all walks of life to promote community bonding, nurture leadership qualities among our women and help the less fortunate. Events and activities organised by WECs offer common space for like-minded people to connect, build new friendships and contribute to community harmony.

The objectives of the WEC are :

* Widen outreach to women of all races to build strong bonds among them;
* Engage women and their families in activities and programmes that meet their needs and interests;
* Create opportunities for women to participate in community and national affairs.

#### Youth Networks
Our YN (Youth Network) is the managing body for the Youth Group in a Community Club. Reaching out to youths, our YN organises a wide range of activities and projects ranging from sports and recreation to culture, arts and community service.

The role of YNs include:

*   Developing programmes for youths and setting up subcommittees to implement its activities
*   Working closely with the Community Club Management Committee and other grassroots organisations in putting together community development projects; and
*   Connecting with other Youth Clubs and the Council to support the People’s Association Youth Movement (PAYM)

MAECs organise cultural, educational, social, recreational and sporting activities to promote mutual respect and harmonious relations between the Malays and other communities.
