#### Community Club Management Committees

Our Community Club Management Committees (CCMCs) help build, manage and maintain all our Community Clubs (CCs). Made up of volunteers who work with our staff, the CCMCs meet regularly to plan and organise innovative programmes that help bring residents together at the CCs to interact and forge friendships.

#### What role does the CCMCs play?

Our CCMCs promote racial harmony and social cohesion through the various cultural, educational, recreational, sporting, social and other community-based activities organised specially for residents. Our CCMCs manage all the CCs, ensure that all CCs keep up with the expectations and needs of residents, and organise creative and innovative courses and activities for residents in the community.

#### Executive Committees
To help the CCMCs achieve their objectives, various executive committees were set up to focus on different areas. These executive committees are under the purview of the CCMCs and help ensure that different segments of residents are well looked after.
