<h4>Welcome Lobby </h4>
<p></p>
<p>Begin your journey by collecting your personalised RFID tag to optimise
the interactive experience throughout your visit. Discover what makes Singapore's
community building unique through inspiring stories, interactive quizzes,
and mini-games, and learn how ordinary individuals have both contributed
to and benefited from being part of our community.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>1 | Singapore's Turbulent Beginnings</h4>
<p>Step back in time to understand how the peace and harmony we enjoy in
Singapore today is not a natural state of affairs, but a constant work-in-progress.
Experience Singapore's complex past as a diverse society of migrants with
divided loyalties, lacking unity and facing social unrest. Gain a deeper
appreciation for how far we've come as a nation.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>2 | Forging Our Path to Social Cohesion</h4>
<p>Journey through six decades of community development across three compelling
themes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

to live and thrive together</p>

spaces and community initiatives bind us as one</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Learn how we built the community, fresh out of a turbulent period, and

we turned the vision of a multi-racial society into reality as Singapore
responded to various social challenges and began forging the path to social
cohesion.</p>
