						The aim of this initiative is to provide women from lower-income families the opportunity to supplement their household income through sewing assignments. We work towards helping beneficiaries learn sewing skills and capacity-build. Beneficiaries will learn how to use a sewing machine to make upcycled products such as tote bags, masks, pouches etc, from donated materials such as used banners.<br><br>
We are looking for volunteers to share their knowledge and skills with other volunteers/beneficiaries, and take on sewing projects.
