						           This programme hopes to provide our students taking their PSLE with a supportive and nurturing environment as they prepare for their major exam.&nbsp;<br><br>
As a volunteer, you will assist with subject-specific coaching for the students in English, Maths and Science to strengthen their understanding and knowledge.&nbsp; Volunteers will also assist to promote mental well-being through engaging the students with activities and board games.
