<p>Deepavali is a beautiful festival celebrated by the Hindu, Sikh and other
communities in Singapore which serves as a reminder of the triumph of light
over darkness and good over evil. It is a time for families to come together,
share joy, and strengthen bonds through traditions and festivities.&nbsp;</p>
