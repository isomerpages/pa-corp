<p><strong>1.&nbsp;How has the PA Scholarship supported you in your academic journey?</strong> 
<br>I was fortunate to be awarded the PA Mid-Term Undergraduate Scholarship
during my studies at the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. The
scholarship enabled me to focus my energies on academic learning and research
in Public Policy and Global Affairs, which I majored in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fondly recall my semester exchange to the University of Hong Kong, which
was fully funded by PA. Through this cherished opportunity, I was able
to gain firsthand insights on the politics, economics, and culture of Hong
Kong and the larger East Asia region, both in and out of the classroom.
Academics aside, I was also fortunate to make lasting friendships and expand
my network through the exchange!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;What is the culture like at PA?</strong> 
<br>PA has a people-oriented and dynamic culture, where passionate officers
work closely together to serve residents on the ground and plan for impactful
programmes.&nbsp;Given that we work with Grassroots Leaders, community
volunteers, corporates, agencies partners, community partners, as well
as residents in our day-to-day work, PA also has a strong collaborative
culture where we aim to work closely with the community in building social
capital!&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Share with us some memorable stories and/or experiences in PA.</strong> 
<br>My most memorable experiences with PA would be being part of the CDC Vouchers
Scheme and the Chinatown Festivals respectively.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As part of the team behind the digital CDC Vouchers Team which first launched
in Dec 2021, it was an arduous but meaningful journey in ensuring the smooth
implementation of the scheme. Though the team burnt many late nights in
planning for the policies, operations, communications and other aspects,
it brought great satisfaction to see many Singaporean households, heartland
merchants, and hawkers benefiting from the Scheme.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Chinatown Festivals comprise the annual Chinatown Chinese New Year
Celebrations and Mid-Autumn Festival respectively. As these two large-scale
festivals are of important cultural significance, the organising committee
and supporting staff had to put in a huge amount of preparation months
before the actual festival. Being a part of organising these festivals
enriched my experience in organising large-scale events and gave me a sense
of the immense work that goes on behind the scenes.</p>

</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;How is your experience so far, being seconded to MCCY?</strong> 
<br>My secondment to the SG Cares Office has been an eye opening and rewarding
experience thus far.&nbsp;&nbsp;Being part of the Policy and Plans Team,
the work assignments provided exposure to different types of work from
what a PA officer typically does.&nbsp;I am fortunate to explore my interests
in furthering volunteerism in Singapore with the SG Cares Office. For instance,
I am currently looking at promoting senior volunteerism so that more seniors
can continue to lead active and meaningful lifestyles in their golden years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;What opportunities are there for individuals and scholars with PA?</strong> 
<br>Individuals and scholars in PA can look forward to a meaningful career.
As a large organisation, there are diverse opportunities for officers to
pursue a career of their choice, such as at the Community Clubs/Centres
and the Community Development Councils.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
