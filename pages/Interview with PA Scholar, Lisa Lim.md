<p><strong>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What motivated you to apply for the PA Scholarship?</strong>
</p>
<p>As someone who aspires to find a meaningful career, I was inspired to
apply for the PA Scholarship and partake in PA’s efforts in serving the
community.</p>
<p>Social support from family, community and the government are vital for
all. Unfortunately, many Singaporeans lack this support in their lives.
For example, during my internship with PA, a resident shared his struggles
with discrimination due to a non-visible disability. Upon being notified,
my mentor promptly contacted relevant organisations to raise disability
awareness in Bedok. The immediacy with which my mentor responded to the
situation was admirable to me.</p>
<p>During my internship with PA, I gained insights into the initiatives PA
organises, such as overseeing grassroots committees and organising events.
From the larger community to individual residents, I believe that the social
support PA provides is vital, motivating me to pursue a career in this
organisation.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How has the Scholarship supported you in your academic journey?</strong>
</p>
<p>Knowing that I have a career in the PA after I graduate has lifted the
stress of needing to find a suitable job for myself. This certainty has
allowed me to study with a clear purpose, as I consistently connect relevant
class content with the skills required for my future job.</p>
<p>Additionally, I am extremely grateful to not have to worry about the heavy
financial burden of university while studying. The scholarship has allowed
me to focus on my studies without needing to seek alternative sources of
income to support myself. This grants me the ability to fully immerse myself
in my university’s academic culture and lessons.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What are some valuable experiences you’ve gained as an undergraduate student in university?</strong>
</p>
<p>An invaluable experience I have had in university is living independently
and experiencing the immense freedom that a university environment offers.
Balancing my academic, social, and personal pursuits has honed my time
management and organisational skills, while the independence I enjoy has
fostered a sense of responsibility and self-reliance.</p>
<p>Another valuable experience I have gained is the opportunity to participate
in various event organisation roles in NUS, in both my faculty and residential
college. This has provided me with important work experience and prepared
me better for the roles that I would need to take on at PA.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What kind of impact do you hope to have in your future career with PA?</strong>
</p>
<p>I hope that I can play a role in creating vibrant and cohesive communities
in Singapore.</p>
<p>In an increasingly polarised world, I want to contribute to the larger
movement of “Forward Singapore”, by bridging existing gaps between individuals
to create a more cohesive and united country. I hope to build communities
where people's relationships with their neighbours extend beyond mere geographical
acquaintances, evolving into an extended social support network for one
another.</p>
<p>On a more personal level, I desire to contribute to the loving workplace
culture that I had experienced at the PA during my internship – one that
is forgiving of mistakes and supporting of others, especially during challenging
periods. After all, a supportive, positive social environment should exist
both in the workplaces and communities we envision to live in.</p>
