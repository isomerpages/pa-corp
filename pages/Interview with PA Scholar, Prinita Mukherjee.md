<p><strong>1.&nbsp;How has the PA Scholarship supported you in your academic journey?</strong>
<br>The PA Scholarship has provided me with the unique opportunity to pursue
my academic and personal development goals, opening doors to a liberal
arts education in the US at the Cornell University and a Master degree
in the United Kingdom at the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p>During my 4 years of study, I was able to explore a range of interdisciplinary
fields beyond my major in Anthropology, from Computer Science to French
Film. Immersing myself in these new cultural environments independently
helped me grow into the person I was meant to be and gain a more global
perspective. Whenever I faced any challenges along the way, I knew I could
always reach out to PA for their advice.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;What is the culture like at PA?</strong>
<br>The culture at PA is inclusive, collaborative, and passionate, with the
idea of community truly woven into our work. Everyone is very sincere in
their support, and I am grateful that I can always count on my colleagues
to brighten my day at work, where we give one another a helping hand whenever
someone needs it. It is all about working together to bring about a positive
change, building strong relationships, and bringing people together to
foster harmony and shared moments.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Share with us some stories of your experience in PA so far.</strong>
<br>I believe that finding meaning is important in oneâ€™s professional life,
and I am fortunate to have encountered many meaningful moments during my
journey at PA so far.</p>
<p>I have been part of dynamic teams that have been instrumental in driving
impact in areas such as community wellness, green initiatives and care
initiatives, while simultaneously building social cohesion. However, it
is not just my own stories from these experiences but the stories of the
residents we serve that inspire me.</p>
<p>For instance, I have worked with people who candidly shared about their
mental health struggles in an effort to destigmatise seeking help. I have
worked with caregivers who feel empowered to start a community network
to support fellow caregivers who are struggling. I have worked with fathers
who are passionate about encouraging other fathers to break down the stereotypes
surrounding them and redefine what it means to be strong and masculine.
Each of their stories has certainly left a mark in my life.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;What opportunities are there for individuals and scholars with PA?</strong>
<br>PA provides a wide range of opportunities to attend leadership and skills
training programmes.</p>
<p>While I was a student, I had two internship opportunities at PA with NACLI
and Woodlands Galaxy Community Club. Since I joined full-time in July 2022,
PA has allowed me to work on many cause-based projects that have driven
impact and made a meaningful difference. When I took on a more communications-focused
role, PA also allowed me to attend courses to learn important tools and
add to my skillsets.</p>
