#### Senior Citizens' Executive Committees

<img style="width:600px" align="centre" src="/images/Our%20Programmes/activeageing-scec.jpg">

People’s Association (PA) Senior Citizens’ Executive Committees (SCECs) is the largest seniors’ network in Singapore. The SCECs organise a wide variety of activities to empower seniors to stay active, healthy and socially connected in the community. From gardening, singing, dancing, cooking, arts and crafts to fitness exercises, there is something for everyone. Under the network, there are also many interest groups formed by the seniors for the seniors where seniors can meet like-minded peers and pursue their interests together. Members in interest groups form deep bonds when they meet regularly. Seniors also achieve a deep sense of fulfilment when they are able to impart their experience and knowledge to others.
