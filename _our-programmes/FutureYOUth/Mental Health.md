<p>It's natural to feel that we're in control, or someone else's problems
are always going be bigger than our own. But life's a long journey and
it can sometimes get rocky. There's no shame in asking for a little help
along the way.</p>

<p>1 in 2 Singaporeans think mental health is all about mental illness, but
it’s not quite what it is.</p>
<p>Unlike mental illness, which is clinically diagnosed, mental health is
a spectrum. Our ability to cope, manage stress, and personal lifestyle
habits affect how we move along this spectrum over time and at any given
moment.</p>
<p>If this is the first time you’re learning about this, share it with your
loved ones.</p>

<p>Mental health is important and has an impact on everyone. Each and every
one of us has a role to play in clearing stigma surrounding mental health
conditions. The first step towards this is to show kindness.</p>
<p>Hear from our volunteers and partners from <a href="https://www.silverribbonsingapore.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Silver Ribbon (Singapore)</a> about
their passion for educating the community on mental health issues and looking
out for the mental wellbeing of those around you.</p>

<p>You probably know someone who may be suffering in silence. The stigma
surrounding mental health issues have made these out to be negative, socially
discrediting behaviour. These stereotypes and perceptions only isolate
and alienate those who may need help. Rethinking and reframing our approach
to mental health can help to spark the change in perception towards these
highly prevalent issues.</p>

<p>30 percent is a sizeable portion of Singapore’s youth. For context, in
a class of 20 students, you would have about seven students suffering in
silence. By taking time to check in on the people around you, be it at
work or school, you could ensure they get the necessary help and support.</p>

<p>Mental health is an important component of our overall well-being, yet
it is rarely brought up in social settings. As society is still learning
more about mental health and how to cope with the many conditions and issues,
simply asking yourself and the people around you how they are feeling could
help spark conversations on this topic!</p>
