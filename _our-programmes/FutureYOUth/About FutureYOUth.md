#### **About FutureYOUth** 

<img style="width:600px" align="center" src="/images/01___FutureYOUth_Banner.jpg"><br>
FutureYOUth is a nation-wide movement campaign by the Peopleâ€™s Association Youth Movement (PAYM) to engage a wide spectrum of youth to understand sentiments, aspirations and views on issues that matter to them.

The three themes are:
* Mental Health (relationship with self)
* Racial and Religious Harmony (relationship with others)
* Sustainability &amp; Environment (relationship with the environment)

PAYM pledges to gather 100,000 youth voices from all walks of life through various platforms and channels. The voices of the youth will be distilled to capture youth aspirations and seed ground-up projects with like-minded partners to benefit the community.

At PAYM, we believe that the future belongs to the youth, and we want to empower you to be the change-makers of tomorrow. Your voice matters! Join us in the FutureYOUth campaign and be a part of the movement to create a brighter future for Singapore and Singaporeans. The Future starts with YOU!
