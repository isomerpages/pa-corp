### From our PA Trainers
* “Many people said they do not have the ‘green fingers’ when the primary issue was that they had used the wrong gardening technique. I would like to impart gardening knowledge to the course participants, so that they can also share with their neighbours and friends, and more people can benefit from the knowledge.” – Tony Yau, teaching Creative Gardening at CCs / RCs for 5 years.
* “Although I am demonstrating the art of preparing dishes to the seniors’ participants via virtual classes, they are still able to connect with one another with common topics via the online platforms.  Online culinary classes are equally effective even when I introduce new cooking methods like “sous vide”, which is a relatively new way of cooking via low and regulated temperatures.  I could observe that they are happy to be acquainted with new technology in cooking and having more friends sharing the experiences”.  – Chef Jihardi Bin Mohamed Amin, Culinary Trainer at the CCs/RCs for 10 years.
 

### A Rewarding Experience to Bring People Together through PA Courses
        
The impact of PA Trainers extends beyond the classroom. It’s not just about sharing knowledge; it’s about creating an environment where participants feel encouraged to form meaningful bonds, and build lasting friendships.

The ability to foster these connections is what sets a PA Trainer apart, making the learning journey not only enriching but also deeply fulfilling on a personal level.

Are you interested in bringing your community together through shared interests or passions? Are you an experienced trainer or training partner in areas like leather craft, Piloxing®, and windsurfing?

If you answered yes to all of the above, you are welcome to join us as a PA Training Provider!
