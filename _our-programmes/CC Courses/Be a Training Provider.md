see if the course you intend to teach is listed under the “Accepted” listing
before applying.&nbsp; As some courses have an adequate supply of training
providers, we will not be accepting applications for courses not listed
in the ‘Accepted” listing until&nbsp;further notice.&nbsp; We will continue
to monitor the demand for these courses, and will accept applications at
the next opening window should more training providers required by then.&nbsp;</p>
