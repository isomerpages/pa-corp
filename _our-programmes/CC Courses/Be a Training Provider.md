<h2><strong>General Guidelines to note before applying as a PA Training Provider !</strong></h2>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interested applicants must refer to the Course Subject
Listing to see if the course you intend to teach is listed under the “Accepted”
listing before applying.&nbsp; As some courses have an adequate supply
of training providers, we will not be accepting applications for courses
not listed in the ‘Accepted” listing until&nbsp; further notice.&nbsp;
We will continue to monitor the demand for these courses, and will accept
applications at the next opening window should more training providers
required by then.&nbsp;</p>
