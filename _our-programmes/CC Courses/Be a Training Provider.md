### A Rewarding Experience to  Bring People Together through PA Courses
trating the art of preparing dishes to the seniors’ participants via virtual classes, they are still able to connect with one another with common topics via the online platforms.  Online culinary classes are equally effective even when I introduce new cooking methods like “sous vide”, which is a relatively new way of cooking via low and regulated temperatures.  I could observe that they are happy to be acquainted with new technology in cooking and having more friends sharing the experiences”.  – Chef Jihardi Bin Mohamed Amin, Culinary Trainer at the CCs/RCs for 10 years.
