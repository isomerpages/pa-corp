### From our PA Trainers
* “Many people said they do not have the ‘green fingers’ when the primary issue was that they had used the wrong gardening technique. I would like to impart gardening knowledge to the course participants, so that they can also share with their neighbours and friends, and more people can benefit from the knowledge.” – Tony Yau, teaching Creative Gardening at CCs / RCs for 3 years.
* “Although I am demonstrating the art of preparing dishes to the seniors’ participants via virtual classes, they are still able to connect with one another with common topics via the online platforms.  Online culinary classes are equally effective even when I introduce new cooking methods like “sous vide”, which is a relatively new way of cooking via low and regulated temperatures.  I could observe that they are happy to be acquainted with new technology in cooking and having more friends sharing the experiences”.  – Chef Jihardi Bin Mohamed Amin, Culinary Trainer at the CCs/RCs for 9 years.
