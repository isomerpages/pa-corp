One learns better while having fun!

School Holidays Series are specially curated courses that cater especially to children, aged 4 years and above, as well as their parents during the June and December school holidays. From fun-filled workshops which instill confidence and creativity in craft-work to interactive science sessions, there is always something to pique their interest and an opportunity for them to make more friends. Parents can also look forward to spending quality time bonding with their children through our affordable and exciting parent-child courses.

What are you waiting for? Start your adventures this school holiday with K.D. because the fun never ends!
