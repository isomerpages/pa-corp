<p><strong>"Sparks" is a community innovation movement - by the community, for the community</strong>.&nbsp;
It reflects PA’s refreshed mission to spark and nurture community participation.
As Singapore’s communities become increasingly diverse, this initiative
aims to enhance the role of Community Clubs (CCs), moving beyond traditional
service provision to becoming catalysts for community-led innovation and
solutions that address local challenges and aspirations, fostering a deeper
sense of ownership and unity contributing towards nation building.</p>

<p>To achieve these objectives, PA has introduced three interconnected components
under the “Sparks” umbrella:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Community Innovation Spaces (CIS):</strong> &nbsp;Ten pilot CCs
have been selected to redesign part of their spaces to enable residents,
volunteers, community and corporate partners to come together to brainstorm
ideas, share insights and test out innovative solutions to address community
concerns and bring collective aspirations to fruition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The 10 pilot Sparks @ CC are:</strong>

<p><strong>Community Innovation Taskforces (CIT):</strong> Each of the Sparks

a culture of innovation, drive community participation, and spearhead ideation
sessions and activities within the CIS.</p>

<p><strong>Sparks x BFG Community Hackathon: </strong>A inaugural collaboration
between the PA and <a href="https://open.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Open Government Products</a> (OGP), combining
PA's deep community connections with OGP's technological expertise and
past experience running the <a href="https://www.build.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Build for Good</a> (BFG) hackathon.&nbsp;
The Community Hackathon aims to rally the community to identify pressing
local issues and develop innovative tech solutions that address community
challenges and aspirations. For the past month, participants received support
from CITs, experienced tech mentors, and hands-on workshops to refine their
ideas into prototypes.</p>
