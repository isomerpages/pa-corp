<p><strong>"Sparks" is a community innovation movement - by the community, for the community</strong>.&nbsp;
It reflects PA’s refreshed mission to spark and nurture community participation.
&nbsp;In line with our refreshed mission, we will activate more community
club spaces to drive community participation and foster community ownership.
&nbsp;Residents can look forward to use CC spaces to work together on community
projects – to discuss, engage community stakeholders, plan initiatives,
and rally the community. &nbsp;As Singapore's communities become increasingly
diverse and complex, necessitating a more dynamic and inclusive approach
to community building, the initiative provides platforms that empower stakeholders
to take collective action in addressing local issues and shaping meaningful
solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“Sparks” also aims to enhance the traditional role of the Community
Clubs (CCs) and grassroots organisations, moving beyond service provision
to becoming catalysts for community-led innovation and problem-solving.</p>
<p>At its core, “Sparks” is driven by several key factors:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Empowering Active Citizenship:</strong> &nbsp;There is a growing
desire among Singaporeans to move beyond giving feedback to becoming active
contributors in shaping their communities. &nbsp;“Sparks” provides structured
platforms and resources to channel this energy into tangible community
improvements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Harnessing Local Expertise: &nbsp;</strong>Communities hold a
wealth of experience, skills, and passion that often go untapped. &nbsp;“Sparks”
recognises this potential, providing avenues to harness local expertise
for the common good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Addressing Diverse Needs:</strong> &nbsp;As Singapore's population
becomes more diverse, community needs are increasingly varied and complex.
&nbsp;“Sparks” responds to this by fostering innovative and localised solutions
that are tailored to the unique contexts of different neighbourhoods and
demographic groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strengthening Social Cohesion:</strong> &nbsp;By creating shared
experiences of problem-solving and collaboration, “Sparks” aims to foster
stronger bonds within communities. &nbsp;This helps to build trust, understanding,
and a sense of shared purpose among residents from different backgrounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reimagining Community Spaces:</strong> &nbsp;By transforming CCs
into hubs of innovation and civic engagement, this ensures that they remain
relevant and vital in the lives of residents, serving as nexus points for
community interaction and co-creation.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p></p>
<p>To achieve these objectives, PA has introduced three interconnected components
under the “Sparks” umbrella:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Community Innovation Spaces (CIS):</strong> &nbsp;Ten pilot CCs
have been selected to redesign part of their spaces to enable residents,
volunteers, community and corporate partners to come together to brainstorm
ideas, share insights and test out innovative solutions to address community
concerns and bring collective aspirations to fruition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The 10 pilot Sparks @ CC are:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Central Singapore District: Geylang West CC, Pek Kio CC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>North East District: Buangkok CC, Pasir Ris East CC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>North West District: Nee Soon South CC, Zhenghua CC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>South East District: Mountbatten CC, Kampong Chai Chee CC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>South West District: Boon Lay CC, Tengah CC</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Community Innovation Taskforces (CIT):</strong> &nbsp;Each of the
Sparks @ CC has formed a taskforce, comprising three to eight Grassroots
Leaders and partners who will be the driving force behind the community
innovation journey to foster a culture of innovation, drive community participation,
and spearhead ideation sessions and activities within the CIS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sparks x BFG Community Hackathon: </strong>A collaboration between
the PA and <a href="https://open.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Open Government Products</a> (OGP),
combining PA's deep community connections with OGP's technological expertise
and past experience running the <a href="https://www.build.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Build for Good</a> (BFG) hackathon.&nbsp;
The Community Hackathon aims to rally the community to identify pressing
local issues and develop innovative tech solutions that address community
challenges and aspirations. Participants will receive support from CITs,
experienced tech mentors, and hands-on workshops to refine their ideas
into prototypes, which will be showcased at the hackathon grand finale.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Registration for the Community Hackathon has closed. You may find out
