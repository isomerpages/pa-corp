<p>In addition to participating in the National Day Parade, we organize celebrations
at the community level, held at Community Clubs and other local venues.
These community events provide a platform for residents to come together
and celebrate National Day within their own neighbourhoods, fostering a
sense of community and belonging while strengthening local bonds.</p>
<p>Through traditional performances, interactive workshops, and heritage
showcases, we aim to immerse residents in the rich cultural tapestry of
Singapore, fostering a deep sense of national pride and identity. Furthermore,
our virtual experiences, including online concerts, educational webinars,
and digital exhibitions, capture the essence of National Day, allowing
the community to participate from the comfort of their homes.</p>
<p>By bringing the community together to honour Singapore's past, present,
and future, PA reinforces the strength and unity of our nation, creating
cherished memories and reaffirming our commitment to building a cohesive
and inclusive Singapore.</p>
