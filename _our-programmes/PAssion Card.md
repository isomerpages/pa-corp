The PAssion Card is a membership card of the People's Association (PA).

In November 2009, the PAssion ez-link Card was launched. Besides offering our members exclusive privileges for our exciting range of courses, activities and programmes, the PAssion Card also offers unique promotions via our tie-ups with our lifestyle merchants and partners.

The TapForMore (TFM) Rewards Programme was launched in April 2010 and allows members to earn and redeem TFM points when they shop at Cold Storage, Giant and Guardian Health & Beauty stores. For more information on the TFM Rewards Programme, please log on to [https://tapformore.com.sg/](https://tapformore.com.sg/.)

PAssion Card Members also get to enjoy exclusive privileges on eCapitaVoucher and deals on the CapitaStar App. To enjoy this privilege, download the CapitaStar App and activate your CapitaStar
privileges.

In January 2014, the PAssion POSB Debit Card – the must-have card for everyone in Singapore – was introduced jointly by PA and POSB. The all-in-one PAssion POSB Debit Card allows you to enjoy greater savings, rewards and privileges at over 2,500 places islandwide. What’s more, it also works as an ATM, NETS, Debit MasterCard® and EZ-Link card to give you all the convenience you need.

The PAssion Silver Concession Card, launched in December 2016, is one of 70 initiatives under the Action Plan for Successful Ageing and spearheaded by the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Transport and PA with support from the Land Transport Authority.

 

The Card merges the existing purple Senior Citizen Concession Card and PAssion Card programme, and will serve as a common identifier for the community and businesses to honour our seniors. With the PAssion Silver Concession Card, seniors will be able to enjoy concessionary fares on public transport, in addition to a suite of merchant benefits and privileges. By leveraging on PA’s existing PAssion Card programme, its community network and partners, the programme also enables seniors to continue to stay active, be engaged with the community and live well.

 

Starting July 2018, PAssion Card Members can do good in the community simply by tapping their PAssion Cards at PAssion CARES terminals at selected community events. With each tap of your PAssion Card, 7.5 TFM points will be contributed to community projects, while another 7.5 TFM points will be credited to your PAssion Card in appreciation of your support towards PAssion CARES. This initiative is fully supported by our long-term partners, Dairy Farm International Retail Group (DFI Retail Group) and POSB. The TFM points raised will go towards various community projects benefitting the underprivileged in the community.


As a PAssion Card Member, there’s always something to look forward to.
