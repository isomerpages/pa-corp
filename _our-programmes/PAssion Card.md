In November 2009, the PAssion EZ-Link Card was launched. Besides offering our members exclusive privileges for our exciting range of courses, activities and programmes, the [PAssion Card](www.onepa.gov.sg/passion-card) also offers unique promotions via our tie-ups with our lifestyle merchants and partners.

In January 2014, the [PAssion POSB Debit Card](http://www.posb.com.sg/passion) – the must-have card for everyone in Singapore – was introduced jointly by PA and POSB. The all-in-one PAssion POSB Debit Card allows you to enjoy greater savings, rewards and privileges at over 2,500 places islandwide. What’s more, it also works as an ATM, NETS, Debit MasterCard® and EZ-Link card to give you all the convenience you need.

The [PAssion Silver Concession Card](https://www.onepa.gov.sg/passion-card/passion-card-membership/silver-concession-card), launched in December 2016, is one of 70 initiatives under the Action Plan for Successful Ageing and spearheaded by the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Transport and PA with support from the Land Transport Authority.

The Card merges the existing purple Senior Citizen Concession Card and PAssion Card programme, and will serve as a common identifier for the community and businesses to honour our seniors. With the PAssion Silver Concession Card, seniors will be able to enjoy concessionary fares on public transport, in addition to a suite of merchant benefits and privileges. By leveraging on PA’s existing PAssion Card programme, its community network and partners, the programme also enables seniors to continue to stay active, be engaged with the community and live well.

PAssion Members also get to enjoy exclusive privileges on eCapitaVoucher and deals on the CapitaStar App. To enjoy this privilege, download the CapitaStar App and activate your CapitaStar privileges.

From 27 October 2022, PAssion Members can also link their PAssion Card to [yuu Rewards Club]([https://yuu.sg](https://yuu.sg/) and earn yuu Points with ease at 7-Eleven, Cold Storage, CS Fresh, Giant and Guardian outlets. By using the yuu App, you can earn yuu Points for every $1 spent at even more brands. For more information on yuu, please visit https://yuu.sg.

PAssion Members can do good in the community simply by scanning the [PAssion CARES](https://www.onepa.gov.sg/passion-card/what-is-passion-cares) QR code or tapping their PAssion Cards at PAssion CARES terminals at selected community events. With each successful participation, 10 yuu Points will be contributed to community projects, while another 10 yuu Points will be credited to your PAssion Card in appreciation of your support towards PAssion CARES. This initiative is fully supported by our partners, POSB and yuu Rewards Club. The yuu Points raised will go towards various community projects benefitting the underprivileged in the community.
