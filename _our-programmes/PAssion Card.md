<p>In November 2009, the PAssion EZ-Link Card was launched. Besides offering
our members exclusive privileges for our exciting range of courses, activities
and programmes, the <a href="https://www.onepa.gov.sg/passion-card" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PAssion Card</a> also offers
unique promotions via our tie-ups with our lifestyle merchants and partners.</p>
<p>In January 2014, the <a href="https://www.posb.com.sg/passion" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PAssion POSB Debit Card</a> – the
must-have card for everyone in Singapore – was introduced jointly by PA
and POSB. The all-in-one PAssion POSB Debit Card allows you to enjoy greater
savings, rewards and privileges at over 2,500 places islandwide. What’s
more, it also works as an ATM, NETS, Debit MasterCard® and EZ-Link card
to give you all the convenience you need.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.onepa.gov.sg/passion-card/passion-card-membership/silver-concession-card" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PAssion Silver Concession Card</a>,
launched in December 2016, is one of 70 initiatives under the Action Plan
for Successful Ageing and spearheaded by the Ministry of Health, Ministry
of Transport and PA with support from the Land Transport Authority.</p>
<p>The Card merges the existing purple Senior Citizen Concession Card and
PAssion Card programme, and will serve as a common identifier for the community
and businesses to honour our seniors. With the PAssion Silver Concession
Card, seniors will be able to enjoy concessionary fares on public transport,
in addition to a suite of merchant benefits and privileges. By leveraging
on PA’s existing PAssion Card programme, its community network and partners,
the programme also enables seniors to continue to stay active, be engaged
with the community and live well.</p>
<p>PAssion Members also get to enjoy exclusive privileges on eCapitaVoucher
and deals on the CapitaStar App. To enjoy this privilege, download the
CapitaStar App and activate your CapitaStar privileges.</p>
<p>From 27 October 2022, PAssion Members can also link their PAssion Card
to <a href="https://yuu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">yuu Rewards Club</a> and
earn yuu Points with ease at 7-Eleven, Cold Storage, CS Fresh, Giant and
Guardian outlets. By using the yuu App, you can earn yuu Points for every
$1 spent at even more brands. For more information on yuu, please visit
<a href="https://yuu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://yuu.sg.</a>
</p>
<p>PAssion Members can do good in the community simply by scanning the
<a href="https://www.onepa.gov.sg/passion-card/what-is-passion-cares" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PAssion CARES</a>QR code or tapping their PAssion Cards at PAssion CARES
terminals at selected community events. With each successful participation,
10 yuu Points will be contributed to community projects, while another
10 yuu Points will be credited to your PAssion Card in appreciation of
your support towards PAssion CARES. This initiative is fully supported
by our partners, POSB and yuu Rewards Club. The yuu Points raised will
go towards various community projects benefitting the underprivileged in
the community.</p>
