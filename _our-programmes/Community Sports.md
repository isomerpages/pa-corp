<p>Initiated in 2004 by the People’s Association (PA) with support from POSB
PAssion Kids Fund, the PAssion Community Football (PACF) Programme provides
a platform for participants aged five to 16 years old to spend quality
family time with their parents and bond with the community through their
common passion for Football.</p>
<p>With the motto of “Every Child is a Champion”, the objective of the PACF
Programme is to promote family and community bonding while developing participant’s
physical and social skills through football.</p>
<p>Being a volunteer-initiated football programme, parent volunteers are
an integral part of the programme. Regular training courses are organised
to equip the volunteers with the skills on Grassroots Football Coaching,
First-Aid and more.</p>
<p>Interested to sign up your child for the programme or sign up as a parent
volunteer? Please fill up the interest form <a href="https://go.gov.sg/pacf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
