The People’s Association works through Community Sports Networks (CSNs) to foster community bonding through a wide array of sports activities for residents to participate and interact with one another.

Over the years, the CSN has curated flagship programmes like the evergreen PAssion Community Football.

The CSNs at the grassroots level organises an array of activities such as brisk walks, mass swims, sports carnivals, bowling, badminton, football and sepak takraw, and in recent years also included disc golf, kin-ball and floorball.

### PAssion Community Football

<img style="width:600px" src="/images/Programmes/Community%20sports/commsports-passionfootball.jpg">

The PAssion Community Football (PACF) programme was initiated in 2004 by the People’s Association (PA).  In partnership with the Football Association of Singapore and POSB PAssion Kids Fund, the programme is a platform for participants aged five to 16 years old to spend quality family time with their parents and bond with the community through football.

With the motto “Every Child is a Champion,” the objectives of PAssion Community Football are to promote family and community bonding while developing participant’s physical and social skills through football.

Parent Volunteers are a vital part of the programme and thus parents are encouraged to participate as assistant coaches and facilitators.  Regular workshops are organised to equip Parent Volunteers with the knowledge and skills on football training for participants, first-aid and other topics.
