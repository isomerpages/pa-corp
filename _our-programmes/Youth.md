##### PAYM Service-Learning Champion

The PAYM reaches out to youths in secondary schools via the Service-Learning Champion (SLC) Scheme, which aims to promote holistic development in youths by enabling them to achieve personal, character and academic development, and acquire values, life skills, a sense of civil responsibility and commitment through being involved in community service.

A strong emphasis on personal development and hands-on experiences greatly enhance the learning experience of students. SLCs are encouraged to organise a wide variety of service activities to meet the needs of their community, and to tap on their own talents and initiatives in the process.


##### Community Leadership Programme

The Community Leadership Programme (CLP) is developed to expose students to grassroots work and a diverse range of volunteer activities.

Students will be attached to the Youth Executive Committees (YECs) and mentored by experienced YEC leaders. Students will be challenged to step out of their comfort zones through a journey of experiential learning, community projects, leadership workshops, house-to-house visits, dialogue sessions and participation in national campaigns – PAYM Loves Red and YOUths Care @ PAYM.

Through CLP, the students will not only hone their leadership skills but also cultivate a sense of appreciation on the importance of bridging diverse communities.

##### Interests Groups

Interest groups are formed by the youths for the youths at the CCs where youths can meet like-minded peers and pursue their interests together.

These interest groups are excellent platforms for youths to interact regularly, share resources and forge meaningful friendships.

Popular interest groups include beach volleyball, archery, cheerleading, yo-yo, performing arts and astronomy.

##### Community Service Programmes

To build a civic-conscious youth community, the PAYM also provides platforms for youths to contribute to the wider community.


##### Forum and Dialogue Series

The PAYM engages both schooling and working youths and heightens their sense of belonging in the community by consulting their views on current issues and national policies through a series of different forums and dialogues lined up every year.

The “PAYM Loves Red” supports and encourages all youths to organise meaningful and interesting National Day celebratory activities in the months of July and August. Through these projects, youths can connect with their peers and local residents, and together, display the vibrant energy, passion and their patriotism toward the nation in creative and unique ways.
