##### People's Association Youth Movement Programmes

As a leading youth organisation, the People's Association Youth Movement (PAYM) was set up in 1971 as a core youth movement in Singapore to engage youth in meaningful pursuits and support the Government in nation building. Through our strategy of ‘Youth for Youth, Youth for Community’, PAYM provides diverse and holistic activities for our youths to develop into active citizens.

Involving over 90 Youth Networks based at the Community Clubs/Centres (CCs), PAYM’s various programs and activities create a common space for youth to bond and contribute to their local communities regardless of race, religion and educational backgrounds. Over at PAYM, we proactively create opportunities for our youth to unleash their potentials and fulfil their aspirations.

##### PAYM&nbsp;Service-Learning Champion

The PAYM reaches out to youths in secondary schools via the Service-Learning Champion (SLC) Scheme, which aims to promote holistic development in youths by enabling them to achieve personal, character and academic development, and acquire values, life skills, a sense of civic responsibility and commitment through being involved in community service.

A strong emphasis on personal development and hands-on experiences greatly enhance the learning experience of students. SLCs are encouraged to organise a wide variety of service activities to meet the needs of their community, and to tap on their own talents and initiatives in the process.

The Community Leadership Programme (CLP) is developed to introduce students from Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL) to community work and a diverse range of volunteer activities

Students will be attached to the Youth Networks (YN) and mentored by experienced YN leaders. Students will embark on a journey of experiential learning, community projects, leadership workshops, house-to-house visits, dialogue sessions and participation in national campaigns – PAYM Loves Red and Community YOUthCare Festival.

Through CLP, the students will not only hone their leadership skills but also cultivate a sense of appreciation on the importance of bridging diverse communities.

##### Interest Groups

Interest groups are formed by the youths for the youths at the CCs where youths can meet like-minded peers and pursue their interests together.

These interest groups are excellent platforms for youths to interact regularly, share resources and forge meaningful friendships.

Popular interest groups include beach volleyball, archery, cheerleading, yo-yo, performing arts and astronomy.
