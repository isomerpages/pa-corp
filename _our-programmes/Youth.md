### People's Association Youth Movement

As a leading youth organisation, the People’s Association Youth Movement (PAYM) has been reaching out to youths in Singapore since its inception in 1971. It offers a wide spectrum of interesting and meaningful programmes and initiatives to excite, engage and and empower the youths in creating a vibrant youth community.The PAYM network currently consists of over 90 Youth Networks based at the CCs.

### PAYM’s Youth Engagement Framework

The Youth Networks under the umbrella of PAYM build social capital amongst youths, and through the youth by helping them to enrich the lives of others. The PAYM’s youth engagement framework includes programmes targeting youth profiles, interest-driven activities to meet the diverse interests of youths, opportunities for youths to do their part for the community, and highpoint engagement events to bring more youths together. A multi-prong approach is adopted for PAYM’s youth engagement framework.

##### People's Association Youth Movement Programmes
----------------------------------------------

As a leading youth organisation, the People's Association Youth Movement (PAYM) was set up in 1971 as a core youth movement in Singapore to engage youth in meaningful pursuits and support the Government in nation building. Through our strategy of ‘Youth for Youth, Youth for Community’, PAYM provides diverse and holistic activities for our youths to develop into active citizens.

Involving over 90 Youth Networks based at the Community Clubs/Centres (CCs), PAYM’s various programs and activities create a common space for youth to bond and contribute to their local communities regardless of race, religion and educational backgrounds. Over at PAYM, we proactively create opportunities for our youth to unleash their potentials and fulfil their aspirations.

<img style="height:200px;width:250px" align="left" src="/images/Programmes/Youth/SLC.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The PAYM reaches out to youths in secondary schools via the Service-Learning Champion (SLC) Scheme, which aims to promote holistic development in youths by enabling them to achieve personal, character and academic development, and acquire values, life skills, a sense of civil responsibility and commitment through being involved in community service.

A strong emphasis on personal development and hands-on experiences greatly enhance the learning experience of students. SLCs are encouraged to organise a wide variety of service activities to meet the needs of their community, and to tap on their own talents and initiatives in the process.

Interest groups are formed by the youths for the youths at the CCs where youths can meet like-minded peers and pursue their interests together.

These interest groups are excellent platforms for youths to interact regularly, share resources and forge meaningful friendships.

Popular interest groups include beach volleyball, archery, cheerleading, yo-yo, performing arts and astronomy.
