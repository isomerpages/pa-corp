<p>PAssion Wave (PW) was first coined in 2015 as PA’s Specialist Community
Club (SCC). PW is an integral part of the PA that <strong>delivers safe and affordable experiences by the water</strong> .
PW create opportunities for the community, especially amongst the youth,
working professionals and young families, with interest in outdoor and
lifestyle activities to <strong>learn, play, bond and care for the nature and community</strong>.</p>
<p>Creatively using water sports and lifestyle activities as the engagement
platforms, the three strategic focuses of PW are:</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability &amp; Inclusivity</strong>
<br>• Giving back to the community through cause-based volunteerism to encourage
greater participation and sense of ownership.</p>
<p><strong>Water sports &amp; Lifestyle programmes</strong>
<br>• Creating shared experiences by the water through innovative and inclusive
programmes.</p>
<p><strong>Informal Groups/ Networks</strong>
<br>• Connect interest and cause-based groups &amp; networks through common
interests and causes to create impactful outcomes for the community.</p>
<p>PW offers sports equipment for rental with a valid certification required
for certain sports like windsurfing, stand up paddling, and sport climbing.
To avoid disappointment, it is encouraged to pre-book the sports equipments
before heading down for the rental.</p>
