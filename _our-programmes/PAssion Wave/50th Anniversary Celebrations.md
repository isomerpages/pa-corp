<h2>PAssion Wave celebrates its 50th Anniversary</h2>
<p>PAssion Wave celebrates five decades of connecting communities of all
ages and abilities through accessible and affordable water sports and waterfront
lifestyle activities.</p>
<p>In 1974, the People’s Association established the PA Adventure Club at
Changi Point, marking the beginning of canoe clubs and sea sports centres
at Punggol Point, Sembawang, and Kallang River.</p>
<p>These efforts evolved into the current six modern and well-equipped PAssion
Wave outlets, including three reservoir outlets (Bedok Reservoir, Jurong
Lake Gardens, Marina Bay) and three sea outlets (East Coast, Sembawang,
Pasir Ris), promoting a broader range of waterfront and meaningful community
programmes with water sports.</p>
