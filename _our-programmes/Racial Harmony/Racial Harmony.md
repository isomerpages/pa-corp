<p>Many local-level racial harmony programmes are organised by the grassroots
organisations to raise the level of understanding amongst neighbours of
different races. In recent years, more focus has been given to programmes
that encourage community participation to deepen inter-racial understanding
among residents. Some of the efforts include bringing residents from various
races and ethnic groups together to develop and organise racial harmony
programmes.</p>
