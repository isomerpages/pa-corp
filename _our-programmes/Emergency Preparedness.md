<p>The People's Association (PA) Community Emergency and Engagement Committees
(C2Es) seek to strengthen the understanding and ties between people of
different race and religions, impart Emergency Preparedness (EP) skills
and knowledge with an aim to build a safer and more resilient community.</p>
<p>Through PA and its Grassroots' EP Programmes, residents will not only
acquire EP skills and take part in emergency exercises, but also learn
about the importance of racial harmony as a fundamental building block
in strengthening our social fabric. The objective of the EP Programmes
is to help the community stay calm, be resilient during emergencies and
return to normalcy as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The PA Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) was established in 2004
to allow residents to volunteer and actively participate in keeping their
community safe and secure. As PA CERT commemorates its 20th Anniversary
this year, a series of local commemorative activities and CERT challenges
has been launched across Singapore.</p>

<p>Take part in EP programmes organised by our Grassroots Organisations to
prepare us to respond and render help promptly during emergencies. This
can be achieved through joining our Community Emergency Response Team (CERT),
participate in Community Resilience (CR) Days, learning useful skills such
as Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) + Automated External Defibrillator
(AED) and other EP-related courses.</p>

<p>PA C2Es organise lifesaving trainings to enhance the community's level
of preparedness and responsiveness in emergencies. Fully subsidised courses
available for residents are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Standard First Aid + AED Awareness Course (SFAA)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CPR+AED Certification Course</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Join our Community Emergency Response Team</h3>
<p>A wide range of EP activities and programmes are organised at the constituencies
all year round. Through the C2Es and CERT, PA and its GROs work with other
government agencies to prepare, train and support the community to deal
with emergencies which include the threat of terrorism. Members of the
community are encouraged to join the CERT to pick up essential EP skills
to help one another during peacetime and emergencies, and promote social
cohesion.</p>
<p>CERT is an organised group of volunteers equipped with specialised training
to respond to emergencies and assist the community in the recovery process.
The main role of the CERT is to strengthen the emergency response capabilities
of the local community. All CERT members would be trained in CPR+AED and
active CERT members would undergo the certified SFA course, Psychological
First Aid Training and other EP related courses to enable them to carry
out duties in times of activation. During peacetime, CERT members will
be deployed for national level events such as PA Chingay Celebrations,
National Day Parade and F1 to perform simple first aid and crowd control
duties.</p>
