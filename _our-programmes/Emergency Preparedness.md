<p>The People's Association (PA) Community Emergency and Engagement Committees (C2Es) seek to strengthen the understanding and ties between people of different race and religions, impart Emergency Prepardness (EP) skills and knowledge with an aim to build a safer and more resilient community.</p><p>Through PA and its Grassroots' EP Programmes, residents will not only acquire EP skills and take part in emergency exercises, but also learn about the importance of racial harmony as a fundamental building block in strengthening our social fabric. The objective of the EP Programmes is to help the community stay calm, be resilient during emergencies and return to normalcy as quickly as possible.</p><h3>Emergency Preparedness Programme</h3><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:600px" height="auto" width="100%" alt="volunteers rendering first aid" src="/images/Programmes/Emergency%20Preparedness/Emergency.jpg"></div><p>Take part in EP programmes organised by our Grassroots Organisations to prepare us to respond and render help promptly during emergencies. This can be achieved through joining our Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), participate in EP Days, learning useful skills such as Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) + Automated External Defibrillator (AED) and other EP-related courses jointly organised with the home team agencies.</p><h3>Community Life-saving Programme</h3><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:600px" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Programmes/Emergency%20Preparedness/ep-firstresponder.jpg"></div><p>The Community Life-saving Programme is a collaboration between PA and MHA which aims to enhance the community's level of preparedness and responsiveness in emergencies. Fully subsidised courses available for residents are:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Standard First Aid + AED Awareness Course (SFAA)</p></li><li><p>CPR+AED Certification Course</p></li></ul><h3>Join our Community Emergency Response Team</h3><p>A wide range of EP activities and programmes are organised at the constituencies all year round. Through the C2Es and CERT, PA and its GROs work with other government agencies to prepare, train and support the community to deal with emergencies which include the threat of terrorism. Members of the community are encouraged to join the CERT to pick up essential EP skills to help one another during peacetime and emergencies, and promote social cohesion.</p><p>CERT is an organised group of volunteers equipped with specialised training to respond to emergencies and assist the community in the recovery process. The main role of the CERT is to strengthen the emergency response capabilities of the local community. All CERT members would be trained in CPR+AED and active CERT members would undergo the certified SFA course, Psychological First Aid Training and other EP related courses to enable them to carry out duties in times of activation. During peacetime, CERT members will be deployed for national level events such as PA Chingay Celebrations, National Day Parade and F1 to perform simple first aid and crowd control duties.</p><p>Scan the QR code or click the link below to register to be a CERT member.</p><p></p><p></p><p><a href="http://go.gov.sg/dzdaq0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">http://go.gov.sg/dzdaq0</a></p><p></p><p>Residents can visit the nearest Community Clubs/Centres to sign up or learn more about the eligibility requirements for our EP Programmes.
