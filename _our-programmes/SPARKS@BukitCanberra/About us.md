<b>**About SPARKS@Bukit Canberra**</b><br>

SPARKS@Bukit Canberra serves as a one-stop volunteer centre house at the Bukit Canberra Integrated Hub  , that promotes community bonding through meaningful cause-based outreach projects.    Residents and schools can either join existing projects or co-create localised projects with our youth leaders.<br><br>
SPARKS@Bukit Canberra also works with corporate organisations to customise corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects to reach out to the needy and vulnerable groups in Sembawang GRC. In addition, we also collaborate with corporate partners to organise industry talks and dialogues for PMETs, providing a platform for residents to network with one another and with industry gurus.

<b>Our Belief</b><br>
All of us have 168 hours per week. Through the 2: 168 movement, we invite you to set aside 2 hours for a good cause.<br><br>
Letâ€™s ignite the kampung spirit by a simple gesture of setting aside 2 hours for a good cause.
