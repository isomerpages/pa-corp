<h3>About Community Championship</h3>
<p>Community Championship is a national movement to bring people together through community sports. Community Championship also aims to provide opportunities for residents of all backgrounds to bond together through friendly sports competition. The People's Association Community Sports Network (CSN) is proud to bring back the Community Championship this year.

Whether it's a win or a loss, playing together knits us closer as a community. You can join an existing CSN team in your area or form your own group to participate at the Cluster level. The top teams will represent the Cluster at the SportSG Pesta Sukan, where you'll go toe-to-toe with champs from other Clusters.

Get ready to showcase your skills, embrace the spirit of friendly competition, and be part of this exciting community-building event!</p>
