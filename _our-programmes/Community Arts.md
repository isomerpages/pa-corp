PAssionArts, established by the People’s Association (PA) in 2012 and supported by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, is a community art movement to bring arts and culture to the community; create a common space that allows diverse groups to come together to appreciate, experience arts and culture, as well as foster sense of belonging and create shared memories. Adopting the participatory art approach, we actively involve residents, art champions and artists to build a volunteer-driven, resident-centric and socially-connected community arts movement championing arts for everyone in Singapore.

### PAssionArts Festival

<img style="width:600px" src="/images/Our%20Programmes/commmart-paf.jpeg"><br>
PAssionArts Festival (PAF) is an annual community arts festival organised by the Community Arts &amp; Culture Clubs (CACC). &nbsp;Since its inception in 2012 as a flagship programme, PAF has fostered a sense of togetherness and belonging in the community through the arts, providing people access to quality art programmes and a platform for community collaboration and engagement.&nbsp; Quality performances, hands-on arts activities and visual art exhibitions/installations are curated and organised to showcase the community’s creativity and local talents.

As part of the festival highlight, the National-Level Art Initiative provides opportunities for residents to co-create artistic representations of their neighbourhood to add vibrancy to their HeARTland. Partnering community artists, the CACCs and their residents come together to unleash their creativity, make new friends/fond memories and create art for their neighbourhood!
