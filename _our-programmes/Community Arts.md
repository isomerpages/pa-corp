Established by PA with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, the PAssionArts brand was developed to provide a collective identity to community arts in Singapore. It aims to make arts & culture more accessible to the people by bringing it right to the heart of every constituency in Singapore. The vision is to bring arts & culture to reach “Everyone, Everywhere, Everyday”.

The key PAssionArts programmes include:
* Community Arts and Culture Clubs
* PAssionArts Community Art Gallery
* PAssionArts Festival
* PAssionArts Hotspot
* PAssionArts Inspiration Series
* PAssionArts Volunteer Corps
