What used to be the Telok Ayer Hong Lim Green Community Centre (CC) is now the home to the refurbished imPAct@Hong Lim Green with a brand-new concept. Housed in the heart of the Central Business District (CBD), this one-stop community space aims to empower and enable working professionals to create change and make a difference in the community through the suite of programmes and volunteering opportunities. These include programmes to encourage working professionals to lead an active lifestyle, enhance professional development and give back to the community.
