The PA and its grassroots organisations regularly organise forums and seminars that give residents the opportunity to find out more about government policies and initiatives, to have their concerns addressed and to offer feedback to help refine policies and initiatives.   

### Community Forums
Citizens’ Consultative Committees (CCC) organise community forums to give residents the opportunity to offer constructive ideas on improving their own neighbourhoods and to participate in community building.


### District Meetings
Each Community Development Council (CDC) organises a District Meeting every year to update stakeholders on their programmes and to engage them on upcoming plans.
