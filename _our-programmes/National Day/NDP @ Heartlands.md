<h1><strong>National Day Heartland Celebrations</strong></h1>
<p>Singaporeans can look forward to celebrating National Day on Sunday, 10
August 2025 from 4.00pm to 9.00pm at five heartland locations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Organised by the People's Association (PA) in partnership with the National
Day Parade 2025 (NDP 2025) Executive Committee, the celebrations aim to
bring the festivities closer to Singaporeans. At these sites, residents
can enjoy exciting family-friendly activities co-created by PA and its
grassroots organisations, together with volunteers and partners. Besides
the mobile columns, there will also be exhibits, live performances, and
a grand finale featuring fireworks and a drone show.</p>

<p>The five sites, and their respective themes, are as follows:</p>
