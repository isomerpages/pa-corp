The PA, through its network of Women’s Executive Committees, encourages women to lead active lives and contribute to the community.

#### Women's Executive Committees

**The Women’s Executive Committees (WECs)** organise a wide range of programmes to meet the needs of women from different backgrounds ranging from health matters related to women and family, managing work-life harmony to programmes on parenting, financial literacy and employability. They also help to form interest groups for residents to interact with one another and make more friends, as well as recruit more volunteers to serve the community. There are WECs located at each of the Community Clubs islandwide.

The WECs are guided by the Women's Integration Network (WIN) Council. The Council’s key initiatives include programmes to enable working women and mothers with knowledge and information to better manage work and family life, take charge of their health and their families, as well as to provide a platform for sharing of concerns and forge networks women can turn to for mutual support. The “Better Me, Better Us” is a series of talks that aim to provide women with knowledge and information by covering topics such as health and environmental awareness.



Besides actively promoting partnership to better cater to the needs of women from different backgrounds, the Council has also initiated numerous programmes to support national campaigns such as War Against Diabetes, Smart Nation and Climate Action. Programmes include the ‘WEC SMART Women Enabling Series’ to equip women with useful digital skills to bring convenience to their lives, Zumba parties to encourage women to adopt a healthy lifestyle and upcycling workshops to encourage women and their family to adopt green practices.
