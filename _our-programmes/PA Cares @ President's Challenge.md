<h2>About PA Cares @ President's Challenge 2024</h2>
<p>The President’s Challenge was initiated by former President S R Nathan
in 2000 as a call to the nation to build a more caring and cohesive society,
and to bring the community together to do their part to help the less fortunate.
The PA has been supporting the President’s Challenge every year by fundraising
through our Grassroots Movement and Corporate Entities.</p>
<p>This year, PA is continuing our support towards President’s Challenge
with PA Cares @ President’s Challenge 2024, by raising funds for 65 social
agencies across a wide variety of social causes to help their needy <a href="https://go.gov.sg/papcbene2024" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">beneficiaries</a>.</p>
