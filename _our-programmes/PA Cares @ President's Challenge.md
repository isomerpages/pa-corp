<p>The President’s Challenge was launched in 2000 by then-President Mr S
R Nathan, to rally Singaporeans in building a more caring and cohesive
society, and to support communities in need.
<br>
<br>In 2025, the President’s Challenge was refreshed on achieving more&nbsp;sustained
social impact – by supporting every aspiration, recognising every contribution,
and inspiring others to lift those around them.</p>
