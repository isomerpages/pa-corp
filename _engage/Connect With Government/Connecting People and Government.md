PA staff and grassroots leaders are familiar faces in the community, and residents often approach them to share feedback and learn about government schemes.

**Engaging residents to solicit feedback**

Residents can provide feedback on government policies through regular dialogue sessions, community events, and house visits. Our grassroots listen closely to the community's concerns and share their feedback with the government through public consultations, dialogue sessions, and forum letters.

Examples of initiatives include Ask Kopi Kakis #shareyourviews which engages citizens widely for their views and suggestions on issues that matter to them. The [Forward Singapore](https://www.forwardsingapore.gov.sg) exercise is another initiative where PA and grassroots leaders organised consultations to gather feedback and suggestions from Singaporeans on topics related to building a new social compact for Singapore.

**Relaying information to residents**
 
Grassroots volunteers and PA staff help to share relevant information on government policies and programmes through our community channels and various PA touchpoints. Our volunteers surface feedback and convey information to citizens in a simple and relatable way, based on the needs of the various communities.
