<p>PA staff and grassroots leaders are familiar faces in the community, and
residents often approach them to share feedback and learn about government
schemes.</p>
<p><strong>Engaging residents to solicit feedback</strong>
</p>
<p>Residents can provide feedback on government policies through regular
dialogue sessions, community events, and house visits. Our grassroots listen
closely to the community's concerns and share their feedback with the government
through public consultations, dialogue sessions, and forum letters.</p>
<p>Examples of initiatives include PA ShareYourViews which engages citizens
widely for their views and suggestions on issues that matter to them. The
<a href="https://www.forwardsingapore.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Forward Singapore</a>exercise is another initiative where PA and grassroots
leaders organised consultations to gather feedback and suggestions from
Singaporeans on topics related to building a new social compact for Singapore.</p>

<p><strong>Relaying information to residents</strong>
</p>
<p>Grassroots volunteers and PA staff help to share relevant information
on government policies and programmes through our community channels and
various PA touchpoints. Our volunteers surface feedback and convey information
to citizens in a simple and relatable way, based on the needs of the various
communities.</p>
