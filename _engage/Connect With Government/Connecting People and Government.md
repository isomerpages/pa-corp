PA staff and grassroots leaders are familiar faces in the community, and residents often approach them to share feedback and learn about government schemes.

**Engaging residents to solicit feedback**

Residents can provide feedback on government policies through regular dialogue sessions, community events, and house visits. Our grassroots listen closely to the community's concerns and share their feedback with the government through public consultations, dialogue sessions, and forum letters.

Examples of initiatives include Ask Kopi Kakis #shareyourviews which engages citizens widely for their views and suggestions on issues that matter to them. The [Forward Singapore](https://www.forwardsingapore.gov.sg) exercise is another initiative where PA and grassroots leaders organised consultations to gather feedback and suggestions from Singaporeans on topics related to building a new social compact for Singapore.

**Relaying information to residents**

The grassroots also help residents understand new government policies that affect their lives and disseminate information on government policies through Ask Kopi Kakis (AKK)-branded content. These materials complement content from government agencies and convey information on policies or salient topics in a simple and relatable way. Besides informing residents what benefits they receive from government initiatives, our grassroots also play a key role to communicate challenging policies and seek citizensâ€™ support for these difficult yet necessary policies for the long-term good of Singapore e.g. communicating the rationale for increase in the Goods and Services Tax (GST).
