To communicate government policies to the public in a simple and accessible way, PA introduced the Ask Kopi Kakis (AKK) initiative.

Residents can learn more about key government policies and schemes that they can benefit from by accessing a set of three easy-to-read AKK policy e-booklets in four languages. They contain bite-sized details on a wide range of topics ranging from healthcare subsidies and housing grants, to transport and education schemes that are of interest to residents at various stages of their lives.

Residents can click on the links below to download the e-booklets and share with their family members and friends.<br>
