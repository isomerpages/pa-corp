#### Ask Kopi Kakis

To communicate government policies to the public in a simple and accessible way, PA introduced the Ask Kopi Kakis (AKK) initiative in all Community Centres/Clubs (CCs). Residents can learn more about key government policies and schemes that they can benefit from by visiting any of the Ask Kopi Kakis kiosks conveniently located at 108 CCs island wide. Mobile kiosks are also deployed at community events to engage residents in understanding government policies while participating in activities in their neighbourhood.

The<b> Ask Kopi Kakis booklets</b>, a set of three easy-to-read policy booklets, contain bite-sized details on a wide range of topics ranging from healthcare subsidies and housing grants, to transport and education schemes that are of interest to residents at various stages of their lives.

Residents can visit their nearest CCs to get a copy of the Ask Kopi Kakis booklets, or click on the links below to download a copy.
