Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Mr Lawrence Wong will deliver Singapore’s FY2025 Budget Statement in Parliament on Tuesday, 18 February 2025.

Together with MOF and various agencies, People’s Association (PA) has been engaging the public in the lead-up to Budget 2025. Building on these conversations, PA and its grassroots organisations will be organising post-Budget dialogues in the community to engage residents on Budget 2025 measures. 

Residents who are interested to attend these post-Budget dialogues to find out more about Budget 2025 measures can register their interest at [https://go.gov.sg/postbudget2025](https://go.gov.sg/postbudget2025).

We will be in touch with all registered participants with further details.

The sign-ups will be available until 12pm on Friday, 28 February 2025.
