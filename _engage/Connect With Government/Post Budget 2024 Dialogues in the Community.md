Together with MOF and various agencies, People’s Association (PA) has been engaging the public in the lead-up to Budget 2024. Building on these conversations, PA and its grassroots organisations will be organising post-Budget dialogues to engage residents on Budget 2024 measures. 

Residents who are interested can [register their interest](https://go.gov.sg/postbudget24) to attend post-Budget 2024 dialogues.

The sign-ups will be available until 12pm on Friday, 1 March 2024.
