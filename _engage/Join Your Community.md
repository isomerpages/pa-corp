### Join Your Community

PA builds communities by bringing people with common interests together to interact and bond through various engagement platforms. These can take the form of courses, activities and forming groups for those who have shared interests and causes. That is why many activities and events organised by PA centre around getting residents with similar interests to come together and make friends. Be it Sports, Arts, or other Interest Groups, nothing unites people more than a shared common passion. 

Bringing diverse people together to solve problems in the community also create a sense of community ownership. Our network of [Grassroots Organisations](/our-network/Grassroots-Organisations/Grassroots-Organisations)) such as the Citizens’ Consultative Committees, Community Club Management Committees, Residents’ Committees and Neighbourhood Committees are managed by residents to look after each other.  

In this way, residents expand their social networks and get to know one another better which build mutual trust, friendship and reciprocity amongst them.
