### National Community Leadership Institute

As the training arm of the Peopleâ€™s Association (PA), the National Community Leadership Institute (NACLI) has been developing community leaders since its establishment on 5 October 1964. Our mission is to Develop, Align and Inspire Leaders in Building and Bridging Communities. 

Leadership development is crucial to the continued excellence and growth of community organisations. NACLI offers a wide range of community leadership development programmes in various modalities to equip grassroots leaders and PA staff with practical and applied skills to carry out their work in the community effectively.

To support your continued learning journey as a PA volunteer, explore various learning opportunities ranging from face-to-face courses (held at NACLI or your nearest community center) to e-learning and bite-sized social media learning posts.
