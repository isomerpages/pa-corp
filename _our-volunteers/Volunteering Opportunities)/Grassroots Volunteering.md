<p>Grassroots volunteers form the core of the People’s Association’s (PA)
volunteer network of more than 2,000 Grassroots Organisations (GROs). &nbsp;They
dedicate their time and effort to foster neighbourliness and strengthen
community bonds, through programmes and activities they organise for residents
to meet and connect and providing care for those in need. &nbsp;Grassroots
volunteers also help to communicate government policies and schemes to
residents and collect feedback from them for the government to improve
policies and services.</p>
<p>As a grassroots volunteer, you will play a vital role in supporting our
GROs in spearheading initiatives to better the community and drive meaningful
change. &nbsp;The hands-on exposure to grassroots work will also provide
opportunities for you to leverage or develop your leadership, professional
and/or personal skills while making a positive impact towards the community.</p>
